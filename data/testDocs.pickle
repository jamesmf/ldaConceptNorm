missense mutat wa also found in 2 8% of the gener popul suggest that it is not diseas associ The averag age of diseas onset in those famili harbouring caus mutat wa between 32 3 and 37 4 year wherea the famili harbouring the missense mutat had an averag age of onset of 51 2 year These find show that BRCA1 is implic in a small fraction of breast/ovarian cancer famili suggest the involv of anoth suscept gene s breast/ovarian cancer Oral contracept and the risk of hereditari ovarian cancer Hereditari Ovarian Cancer Clinic Studi Group BACKGROUND Women with mutat in either the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene have a high lifetim risk of ovarian cancer Oral contracept protect against ovarian cancer in gener but it is not known whether they also protect against hereditari form of ovarian cancer METHOD We enrol 207 women with hereditari ovarian cancer and 161 of their sister as control in a case control studi All the patient carri a pathogen mutat in either BRCA1 179 women or BRCA2 28 women The control women were enrol regardless of whether or not they had either mutat Lifetim histori of oral contracept use were obtain by interview or by written questionnair and were compar between patient and control women after adjust for year of birth and pariti RESULT The adjust odd ratio for ovarian cancer associ with ani past use of oral contracept wa 0 5 95 percent confid interv 0 3 to 0 8 The risk decreas with increas durat of use P for trend 0 001 use for six or more year wa associ with a 60 percent reduct in risk Oral contracept use protect against ovarian cancer both for carrier of the BRCA1 mutat odd ratio 0 5 95 percent confid interv 0 3 to 0 9 and for carrier of the BRCA2 mutat odd ratio 0 4 95 percent confid interv 0 2 to 1 1 CONCLUS Oral contracept use may reduc the risk of ovarian cancer in women with pathogen mutat in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene Founder BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutat in French Canadian breast and ovarian cancer famili We have identifi four mutat in each of the breast cancer suscept gene BRCA1 and BRCA2 in French Canadian breast cancer and breast/ovarian cancer famili from Quebec To identifi founder effect we examin independ ascertain French Canadian cancer famili for the distribut of these eight mutat Mutat were found in 41 of 97 famili Six of eight mutat were observ at least twice The BRCA1 C4446T mutat wa the most common mutat found follow by the BRCA2 8765delAG mutat Togeth these mutat were found in 28 of 41 famili identifi to have a mutat The odd of detect of ani of the four BRCA1 mutat wa 18 7x greater if one or more case of ovarian cancer were also present in the famili The odd of detect of ani of the four BRCA2 mutat wa 5 3x greater if there were at least five case of breast cancer in the famili Interestingli the presenc of a breast cancer case 36 year of age wa strongli predict of the presenc of ani of the eight mutat screen Carrier of the same mutat from differ famili share similar haplotypes indic that the mutant allel were like to be ident by descent for a mutat in the founder popul The identif of common BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutat will facilit carrier detect in French Canadian breast cancer and breast/ovarian cancer famili Stabl interact between the product of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene in mitot and meiotic cell BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for most case of famili earli onset breast and/or ovarian cancer and encod product that each interact with hRAD51 Result present here show that BRCA1 and BRCA2 coexist in a biochem complex and colocalize in subnuclear foci in somat cell and on the axial element of develop synaptonemal complex Like BRCA1 and RAD51 BRCA2 reloc to PCNA replic site follow exposur of S phase cell to hydroxyurea or UV irradi Thu BRCA1 and BRCA2 particip togeth in a pathway s associ with the activ of doubl strand break repair and/or homolog recombin Dysfunct of thi pathway may be a gener phenomenon in the major of case of hereditari breast and/or ovarian cancer The 185delAG BRCA1 mutat origin befor the dispers of Jew in the diaspora and is not limit to Ashkenazim The 185delAG mutat in BRCA1 is detect in Ashkenazi Jew both in famili breast and ovarian cancer and in the gener popul All test Ashkenazi mutat carrier share the same allelic pattern at the BRCA1 locu Our previou studi show that thi Ashkenazi mutat also occur in Iraqi Jew with a similar allelic pattern We extend our analysi to other non Ashkenazi subset 354 of Moroccan origin 200 Yemenit and 150 Iranian Jew Heteroduplex analysi complement by direct DNA sequenc of abnorm migrat band were employ Four of Moroccan origin 1 1% and none of the Yemenit or Iranian wa a carrier of the 185delAG mutat BRCA1 allelic pattern were determin for four of these individu and for 12 addit non Ashkenazi 185delAG mutat carrier who had breast/ovarian cancer Six non Ashkenazi individu share the common Ashkenazi haplotype four had a close relat pattern and the rest n 6 display a distinct BRCA1 allelic pattern We conclud that the 185delAG BRCA1 mutat occur in some non Ashkenazi popul at rate compar with that of Ashkenazim The major of Jewish 185delAG mutat carrier have a common allelic pattern support the founder effect notion but date the mutat origin to an earlier date than current estim Howev the differ allelic pattern at the BRCA1 locu even in some Jewish mutat carrier might suggest that the mutat aros independ BRCA1 requir for transcript coupl repair of oxid DNA damag The breast and ovarian cancer suscept gene BRCA1 encod a zinc finger protein of unknown function Associ of the BRCA1 protein with the DNA repair protein Rad51 and chang in the phosphorylation and cellular local of the protein after exposur to DNA damag agent are consist with a role for BRCA1 in DNA repair Here it is shown that mous embryon stem cell defici in BRCA1 are defect in the abil to carri out transcript coupl repair of oxid DNA damag and are hypersensit to ioniz radiat and hydrogen peroxid These result suggest that BRCA1 particip directli or indirectli in transcript coupl repair of oxid DNA damag Cell cycl depend colocalization of BARD1 and BRCA1 protein in discret nuclear domain Germ line mutat of the
