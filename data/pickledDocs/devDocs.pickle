V Genet heterogen in hereditari breast cancer: role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 The common hereditari form of breast cancer have been larg attribut to the inherit of mutat in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene Howev it is not yet clear what proport of hereditari breast cancer is explain by BRCA1 and BRCA2 or by some other unidentifi suscept gene s We describ the proport of hereditari breast cancer explain by BRCA1 or BRCA2 in a sampl of North American hereditari breast cancer and assess the evid for addit suscept gene that may confer hereditari breast or ovarian cancer risk Twenti three famili were identifi through two high risk breast cancer research program Genet analysi wa undertaken to establish linkag between the breast or ovarian cancer case and marker on chromosom 17q BRCA1 and 13q BRCA2 Mutat analysi in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene wa also undertaken in all famili The pattern of hereditari cancer in 14 61% of the 23 famili studi wa attribut to BRCA1 by a combin of linkag and mutat analys No famili were attribut to BRCA2 Five famili 22% provid evid against linkag to both BRCA1 and BRCA2 No BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutat were detect in these five famili The BRCA1 or BRCA2 statu of four famili 17% could not be determin BRCA1 and BRCA2 probabl explain the major of hereditari breast cancer that exist in the North American popul Howev one or more addit gene may yet be found that explain some

hereditari breast cancer Complet genomic sequenc and analysi of 117 kb of human DNA contain the gene BRCA1 Over 100 distinct diseas associ mutat have been identifi in the breast ovarian cancer suscept gene BRCA1 Loss of the wild type allel in 90% of tumor from patient with inherit BRCA1 mutat indic tumor suppress function The low incid of somat mutat suggest that BRCA1 inactiv in sporad tumor occur by altern mechan such as interstiti chromosom delet or reduc transcript To identifi possibl featur of the BRCA1 genomic region that may contribut to chromosom instabl as well as potenti transcriptional regulatori element a 117 143 bp DNA sequenc encompass BRCA1 wa obtain by random sequenc of four cosmids identifi from a human chromosom 17 specif librari The 24 exons of BRCA1 span an

BRCA1 gene lie within a duplic region of human chromosom 17q21 To begin to address the hypothesi that abnorm regul of the breast/ovarian cancer suscept gene BRCA1 is a critic step in sporad breast/ovarian tumorigenesis we have determin the detail structur of the BRCA1 genomic region We show that thi region of the genom contain a tandem duplic of approxim 30 kilobases which result in two copi of BRCA1 exons 1 and 2 of exons 1 and 3 of the adjac 1A1 3B gene and of the previous report 295 base pair intergenic region Sequenc analysi of the duplic exons of BRCA1 and 1A1 3B and flank genomic DNA reveal mainten of the intron exon structur and a high degre of nucleotid sequenc ident suggest that these are non process pseudogenes and that the duplic is a recent event in evolutionari term We also show that a process pseudogene of the acid ribosom phosphoprotein P1 ARPP1 is insert directli upstream of pseudo BRCA1 exon 1A We believ that these find could not onli confound BRCA1

V Genet heterogen in hereditari breast cancer: role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 The common hereditari form of breast cancer have been larg attribut to the inherit of mutat in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene Howev it is not yet clear what proport of hereditari breast cancer is explain by BRCA1 and BRCA2 or by some other unidentifi suscept gene s We describ the proport of hereditari breast cancer explain by BRCA1 or BRCA2 in a sampl of North American hereditari breast cancer and assess the evid for addit suscept gene that may confer hereditari breast or ovarian cancer risk Twenti three famili were identifi through two high risk breast cancer research program Genet analysi wa undertaken to establish linkag between the breast or ovarian cancer case and marker on chromosom 17q BRCA1 and 13q BRCA2 Mutat analysi in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene wa also undertaken in all famili The pattern of hereditari cancer in 14 61% of the 23 famili studi wa attribut to BRCA1 by a combin of linkag and mutat analys No famili were attribut to BRCA2 Five famili 22% provid evid against linkag to both BRCA1 and BRCA2 No BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutat were detect in these five famili The BRCA1 or BRCA2 statu of four famili 17% could not be determin BRCA1 and BRCA2 probabl explain the major of hereditari breast cancer that exist in the North American popul Howev one or more addit gene may yet be found that explain some proport of hereditari breast cancer breast or ovarian cancer The tumor suppressor gene Brca1 is requir for embryon cellular prolifer in the mous Mutat of the BRCA1 gone in human are associ with

prolif burst requir for the develop of the differ germ layer breast and ovarian cancer Low incid of BRCA2 mutat in breast carcinoma and other cancer Inherit mutant allel of famili tumour suppressor gene predispos individu to particular type of cancer In addit to an involv in inherit suscept to cancer these tumour suppressor gene are target for somat mutat in sporad cancer of the same type found in the famili form An except is BRCA1 which contribut to a signific fraction of famili breast and ovarian cancer but undergo mutat at veri low rate in sporad breast and ovarian cancer Thi find suggest that other gene may be the princip target for somat mutat in breast carcinoma A second recent identifi famili breast cancer gene BRCA2 ref 5 8 account for a proport of breast cancer roughli equal to BRCA1 Like BRCA1 BRCA2 behav as a dominantli inherit tumour suppressor gene Individu who inherit one mutant allel are at increas risk for breast cancer and the tumours they develop lose the wild type allel by heterozyg delet The BRCA2 code sequenc is huge compos of 26 exons that span 10 443 bp Here we investig the rate of BRCA2 mutat in sporad breast cancer and in a set of cell line that repres

pancreat cancer sporad breast and ovarian cancer BRCA1 mutat in women attend clinic that evalu the risk of breast cancer BACKGROUND To defin the incid of BRCA1 mutat among patient seen in clinic that evalu the risk of breast cancer we analyz DNA sampl from women seen in thi set and construct probabl tabl to provid estim of the likelihood of find a BRCA1 mutat in individu famili METHOD Clinic inform famili histori and blood for DNA analysi were obtain from 263 women with breast cancer Conform sensit gel electrophoresi and DNA sequenc were use to identifi BRCA1 mutat RESULT BRCA1 mutat were identifi in 16 percent of women with a famili histori of breast cancer Onli 7 percent of women from famili with a histori of breast cancer but not ovarian cancer had BRCA1 mutat The rate were higher among women from famili with a histori of both breast and ovarian cancer Among famili member an averag age of less than 55 year at the diagnosi of breast cancer the presenc of ovarian cancer the presenc of breast and ovarian cancer in the same woman and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestri were all associ with an increas risk of detect a BRCA1 mutat No associ wa found between the presenc of bilater breast cancer or the number of breast cancer in a famili and the detect of a BRCA1 mutat or between the posit of the mutat in the BRCA1 gene and the presenc of ovarian cancer in a famili CONCLUS Among women with breast cancer and a famili histori of the diseas the percentag with BRCA1 code region mutat is less than the 45 percent predict by genet linkag analysi These result suggest that even in a

breast cancer and ovarian cancer are thought to be due to highli penetrant mutat in the predispos gene BRCA1 and BRCA2 Howev these mutat are uncommon in the popul and they probabl account for onli a few percent of all breast cancer incid A much larger fraction of breast cancer might in principl be due to common variant which confer more modest individu risk There are sever common polymorph in the BRCA1 gene which gener amino acid substitut We have examin the frequenc of four of these polymorph Gln356Arg Pro871Leu Glu1038Gly and Ser1613Gly in larg seri of breast and ovarian cancer case and
