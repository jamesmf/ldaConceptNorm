V A high incid of BRCA1 mutat in 20 breast ovarian cancer famili We have analyz 20 breast ovarian cancer famili the major of which show posit evid of linkag to chromosom 17q12 for germ line mutat in the BRCA1 gene BRCA1 mutat cosegregating with breast and ovarian cancer suscept were identifi in 16 famili includ 1 famili with a case of male breast cancer Nine of these mutat have not been report previous The major of mutat were found to gener a prematur stop codon lead to the format of a truncat BRCA1 protein of 2% 88% of the expect normal length Two mutat alter the RING finger domain Sequenc of genomic DNA led to the identif of a mutat in the code region of BRCA1 in 12 famili and cDNA analysi reveal an abnorm or miss BRCA1 transcript in 4 of the 8 remain famili A total of eight mutat were associ with a reduc quantiti of BRCA1 transcript We were unabl to detect BRCA1 mutat in 4 of the 20 famili but onli 1 of these wa clearli link to BRCA1 It is expect that the major of clear exampl of the breast ovarian syndrom will be associ with germ line mutat in the code region of BRCA1 breast ovarian cancer breast ovarian cancer breast and ovarian cancer breast ovarian syndrom Decreas express

cancer and analyz the effect of antisense inhibit of BRCA1 on the prolif rate of mammari epitheli cell BRCA1 mRNA level are markedli decreas dure the transit from carcinoma in situ to invas cancer Experiment inhibit of BRCA1 express with antisense oligonucleotides produc acceler growth of normal and malign mammari cell but had no effect on non mammari epitheli cell These studi suggest that BRCA1 may normal serv as a neg regul of mammari epitheli cell growth whose function is compromis in breast cancer either by direct mutat or alter in gene express famili breast and ovarian cancer hCds1 mediat phosphorylation of BRCA1 regul the DNA damag respons Mutat in the BRCA1 ref 1 tumour suppressor gene are found in almost all of the famili with inherit breast and ovarian cancer and about half of the famili with onli breast cancer Although the biochem function of BRCA1 is not well understood it is import for DNA damag repair and cell cycl checkpoint BRCA1 exist in nuclear foci but is hyperphosphorylated and dispers after DNA damag It is not known whether BRCA1 phosphorylation and dispers and it function in DNA damag respons are relat In yeast the DNA damag respons and the replic block checkpoint are mediat partli through the Cds1 kinase famili Here we report that the human Cds1 kinase hCds1/Chk2 regul BRCA1 function after DNA damag by phosphorylating serine 988 of BRCA1 We show that hCds1 and BRCA1 interact and co local within discret nuclear foci but separ after gamma irradi Phosphorylation of BRCA1 at serine 988 is requir for the releas of BRCA1 from hCds1 Thi phosphorylation is also import for the abil of BRCA1 to restor surviv after DNA damag in the BRCA1 mutat cell line HCC1937 inherit breast and ovarian cancer Associ of BRCA1 with the hRad50 hMre11 p95 complex and the DNA damag respons BRCA1 encod a tumor suppressor that is mutat in famili breast and ovarian cancer Here it is shown that BRCA1 interact in vitro and in vivo with hRad50 which form a complex with hMre11 and p95/nibrin Upon irradi BRCA1 wa detect in discret foci in the nucleu which colocalize with hRad50 Format of irradi induc foci posit for BRCA1 hRad50 hMre11 or p95 wa dramat

no somat mutat in tumours have yet been describ To studi the potenti role of BRCA1 in sporad carcinogenesis we analysed the genomic DNA of tumour and normal fraction of 47 ovarian cancer for mutat in BRCA1 use the singl strand conform polymorph techniqu We now describ somat mutat in the DNA of four tumours which also had loss of heterozygosity LOH at a BRCA1 intragenic marker Our data support a tumour suppressor mechan for BRCA1 somat mutat and LOH may result in inactiv of BRCA1 in at least a small number of ovarian cancer breast and ovarian cancer BRCA1 interact with compon of the histone

V Increas high densiti lipoprotein level caus by a common cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene mutat BACKGROUND AND METHOD The plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein CETP catalyz the transfer of cholesteryl ester from high densiti lipoprotein HDL to other lipoproteins We recent describ a Japanes famili with increas HDL level and CETP defici due to a splice defect of the CETP gene To assess the frequenc and phenotyp of thi condit we screen 11 addit famili with high HDL level by mean of a radioimmunoassay for CETP and DNA analysi RESULT We found the same CETP gene mutat in four famili from three differ region of Japan Analysi of restrict fragment length polymorph of the mutant CETP allel show that all probands were homozyg for the ident haplotype Famili member homozyg for CETP defici n 10 had moder hypercholesterolemia mean total cholesterol level SD 7 01 0 83 mmol per liter markedli increas level of HDL cholesterol 4 24 1 01 mmol per liter and apolipoprotein A I and decreas level of low densiti lipoprotein cholesterol 1 99 0 80 mmol per liter and apolipoprotein B Member heterozyg for the defici n 20 whose CETP level were in the lower part of the normal rang had moder increas level of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A I and an increas ratio of HDL subclass 2 to HDL subclass 3 as compar with unaffect famili member 1 5 0 8 vs 0 7 0 4 CETP defici wa not found in six unrel subject with elev HDL cholesterol level who were from differ part of the Unit State CONCLUS CETP defici appear to be a frequent caus of increas HDL level in the popul of Japan possibl becaus of a founder effect The result that we observ in heterozygotes suggest that CETP normal play a part in the regul of level of HDL subclass 2 There wa no evid of prematur atherosclerosi in the famili with CETP defici In fact the lipoprotein profil of person with CETP defici is potenti antiatherogenic and may be associ with an increas life span CETP defici CETP defici CETP defici CETP defici CETP defici CETP defici Genet cholesteryl ester transfer protein defici caus by two preval mutat as a major determin of increas level of high densiti lipoprotein cholesterol Genet determin of HDL

43% for HDL C 60 79 80 99 100 119 and or 120 mg/dl respect Furthermor preval of the D442G and Int14 A mutat were extrem high in a gener sampl of Japanes men n 236 with heterozygote frequenc of 7% and 2% respect These two mutat account for about 10% of the total varianc of HDL C in thi popul The phenotyp in a genet compound heterozygote Int14 T and Int14 A wa similar to that of Int14 A homozygotes no detect CETP and markedli increas HDL C indic that the Int14 T produc a null allel In four D442G homozygotes mean HDL C level 86 26 mg/dl were lower than in Int14 A homozygotes 158 35 mg/dl reflect residu CETP activ in plasma In 47 D442G heterozygotes mean HDL C level were 91 23 mg/dl similar to the level in D442G homozygotes and significantli greater than mean HDL C level in Int14 A heterozygotes 69 15 mg/dl Thu the D442G mutat act differ to the null mutat with weaker effect on HDL in the homozyg state and stronger effect in the heterozygotes suggest domin express of a partial

would caus impair splice of pre messeng RNA The other two probands were heterozyg for the mutat but total lack CETP Their lipoprotein pattern were also similar to those of the two homozygotes Thu other genet defect or metabol factor influenc CETP express are implic The data suggest that the G to A mutat may be common in human plasma CETP defici Furthermor there could be compound heterozygotes
