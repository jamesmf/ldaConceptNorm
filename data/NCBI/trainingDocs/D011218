Prader-Willi syndrome and chromosome 15. A clinical discussion of 20 cases.
A chromosome 15 anomaly was observed in 12 of 20 patients, 17 of whom were clinically suspected of having Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The clinical features of eight cases with 15q11-12 deletion were very similar to those originally described in PWS. On the other hand, the group of normal karyotype patients is heterogeneous, and their features do not strictly correspond to the clinical definition of PWS. However, the hypothesis that PWS is associated with deletion of 15q11-12 can neither explain the apparently balanced translocations of chromosome 15 nor account for the small supernumerary metacentric chromosomes corresponding to an isochromosome 15 for band 15q11 observed in some cases..

Investigation of thermoregulatory characteristics in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome.
A survey instrument is used to assess temperature regulation characteristics in children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) compared to 3 control groups  sibs of PWS patients (SIB), neurodevelopmentally handicapped children (ND), and age and gender matched well children (WC). Significant differences were found between PWS patients, SIB controls, and WC controls in the prevalence of febrile convulsions, fever-associated symptoms, and temperature less than 94 degrees F. No differences were noted in any variable between the PWS patients and the ND controls, suggesting that these abnormalities are not unique to PWS, but can occur in any neurodevelopmentally handicapped individual, further suggesting these do not necessarily reflect syndrome-specific hypothalamic abnormalities..

Submicroscopic deletion in cousins with Prader-Willi syndrome causes a grandmatrilineal inheritance pattern: effects of imprinting.
The Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) critical region on 15q11-q13 is subject to imprinting. PWS becomes apparent when genes on the paternally inherited chromosome are not expressed. Familial PWS is rare. We report on a family in which a male and a female paternal first cousin both have PWS with cytogenetically normal karyotypes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis shows a submicroscopic deletion of SNRPN, but not the closely associated loci D15S10, D15S11, D15S63, and GABRB3. The cousins fathers and two paternal aunts have the same deletion and are clinically normal. The grandmother of the cousins is deceased and not available for study, and their grandfather is not deleted for SNRPN. DNA methylation analysis of D15S63 is consistent with an abnormality of the imprinting center associated with PWS. " Grandmatrilineal " inheritance occurs when a woman with deletion of an imprinted, paternally expressed gene is at risk of having affected grandchildren through her sons. In this case, PWS does not become evident as long as the deletion is passed through the matrilineal line. This represents a unique inheritance pattern due to imprinting..

Expression and imprinting of MAGEL2 suggest a role in Prader-willi syndrome and the homologous murine imprinting phenotype.
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the loss of expression of imprinted genes in chromosome 15q11-q13. Affected individuals exhibit neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay and childhood-onset obesity. Necdin, a protein implicated in the terminal differentiation of neurons, is the only PWS candidate gene to reduce viability when disrupted in a mouse model. In this study, we have characterized MAGEL2 (also known as NDNL1), a gene with 51% amino acid sequence similarity to necdin and located 41 kb distal to NDN in the PWS deletion region. MAGEL2 is expressed predominantly in brain, the primary tissue affected in PWS and in several fetal tissues as shown by northern blot analysis. MAGEL2 is imprinted with monoallelic expression in control brain, and paternal-only expression in the central nervous system as demonstrated by its lack of expression in brain from a PWS-affected individual. The orthologous mouse gene (Magel2) is located within 150 kb of NDN , is imprinted with paternal-only expression and is expressed predominantly in late developmental stages and adult brain as shown by northern blotting, RT-PCR and whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization. Magel2 distribution partially overlaps that of NDN , with strong expression being detected in the central nervous system in mid-gestation mouse embryos by in situ hybridization. We hypothesize that, although loss of necdin expression may be important in the neonatal presentation of PWS, loss of MAGEL2 may be critical to abnormalities in brain development and dysmorphic features in individuals with PWS..

Trisomy 15 with loss of the paternal 15 as a cause of Prader-Willi syndrome due to maternal disomy.
Uniparental disomy has recently been recognized to cause human disorders, including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We describe a particularly instructive case which raises important issues concerning the mechanisms producing uniparental disomy and whose evaluation provides evidence that trisomy may precede uniparental disomy in a fetus. Chorionic villus sampling performed for advanced maternal age revealed trisomy 15 in all direct and cultured cells, though the fetus appeared normal. Chromosome analysis of amniocytes obtained at 15 wk was normal in over 100 cells studied. The child was hypotonic at birth, and high-resolution banding failed to reveal the deletion of 15q11-13, a deletion which is found in 50% -70% of patients with PWS. Over time, typical features of PWS developed. Molecular genetic analysis using probes for chromosome 15 revealed maternal disomy. Maternal nondisjunction with fertilization of a disomic egg by a normal sperm, followed by loss of the paternal 15, is a likely cause of confined placental mosaicism and uniparental disomy in this case of PWS, and advanced maternal age may be a predisposing factor..

Familial Prader-Willi syndrome with apparently normal chromosomes.
We report on 4 sibs (2F, 2M) with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Diagnosis was made clinically on the basis of history, behavior, and physical findings in 3 of the sibs. The other child had died at age 10 months with a history and clinical findings typical of first phase of PWS. Results of chromosome studies on the parents and surviving sibs were normal. The implications of this unusual familial occurrence for our understanding of PWS are discussed..

Growth hormone treatment increases CO(2) response, ventilation and central inspiratory drive in children with Prader-Willi syndrome.
We studied whether the beneficial effects of growth hormone (GH) treatment on growth and body composition in PWS are accompanied by an improvement in respiratory function. We measured resting ventilation, airway occlusion pressure (P (0. 1)) and ventilatory response to CO (2) in nine children, aged 7-14 years, before and 6-9 months after the start of GH treatment. During GH treatment, resting ventilation increased by 26%, P (0. 1) by 72% and the response to CO (2) by 65% (P < 0. 002, < 0. 04 and < 0. 02, respectively). This observed increase in ventilatory output was not correlated to changes in body mass index. CONCLUSION  Treatment of children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) seems to have a stimulatory effect on central respiratory structures. The observed increase in ventilation and inspiratory drive may contribute to the improved activity level reported by parents of PWS children during growth hormone therapy

Maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 in a boy with a normal karyotype.
We report on a boy with a maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 (UPD (14)). At 7 years of age he was referred to us by the paediatrician because of symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). He showed short stature, obesity, mild developmental delay, cryptorchidism, and some mild dysmorphic features. The history further indicated intrauterine growth retardation at the end of the pregnancy. His mother was 44 years of age at the time of his birth. After birth he showed hypotonia with poor sucking, for which gavage feeding was needed. Motor development was delayed. After 1 year he became obese despite a normal appetite. Recurrent middle ear infections, a high pain threshold, and a great skill with jigsaw puzzles were reported. There were no behavioural problems or sleep disturbance. Chromosomal analysis was normal (46, XY). DNA analysis for Prader-Willi syndrome showed no abnormalities. Two years later he was re-examined because we thought his features fitted the PWS-like phenotype associated with maternal UPD (14). At that time precocious puberty was evident. DNA analysis showed maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14. In all the previously described 11 cases with maternal UPD (14), a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 was detected cytogenetically before DNA analysis. This is the first report of diagnosis of maternal UPD (14) based on clinical features. This finding underlines the importance of DNA analysis for maternal UPD (14) in patients with a similar PWS-like phenotype even without previous identification of a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14..

Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN), an expressed gene in the Prader-Willi syndrome critical region.
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is associated with paternally derived chromosomal deletions in region 15q11-13 or with maternal disomy for chromosome 15. Therefore, loss of the expressed paternal alleles of maternally imprinted genes must be responsible for the PWS phenotype. We have mapped the gene encoding the small nuclear RNA associated polypeptide SmN (SNRPN) to human chromosome 15q12 and a processed pseudogene SNRPNP1 to chromosome region 6pter-p21. Furthermore, SNRPN was mapped to the minimal deletion interval that is critical for PWS. The fact that the mouse Snrpn gene is maternally imprinted in brain suggests that loss of the paternally derived SNRPN allele may be involved in the PWS phenotype..

Identification of novel imprinted transcripts in the Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome deletion region: further evidence for regional imprinting control.
Deletions and other abnormalities of human chromosome 15q11-q13 are associated with two developmental disorders, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS). Loss of expression of imprinted, paternally expressed genes has been implicated in PWS. However, the number of imprinted genes that contribute to PWS, and the range over which the imprinting signal acts to silence one copy of the gene in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, are unknown. To identify additional imprinted genes that could contribute to the PWS phenotype and to understand the regional control of imprinting in 15q11-q13, we have constructed an imprinted transcript map of the PWS-AS deletion interval. The imprinting status of 22 expressed sequence tags derived from the radiation-hybrid human transcript maps or physical maps was determined in a reverse transcriptase-PCR assay and correlated with the position of the transcripts on the physical map. Seven new paternally expressed transcripts localize to an approximately 1. 5-Mb domain surrounding the SNRPN-associated imprinting center, which already includes four imprinted, paternally expressed genes. All other tested new transcripts in the deletion region were expressed from both alleles. A domain of exclusive paternal expression surrounding the imprinting center suggests strong regional control of the imprinting process. This study provides the means for further investigation of additional genes that cause or modify the phenotypes associated with rearrangements of 15q11-q13.

A transgene insertion creating a heritable chromosome deletion mouse model of Prader-Willi and angelman syndromes.
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) result from the loss of function of imprinted genes in human chromosome 15q11-q13. The central part of mouse chromosome 7 is homologous to human 15q11-q13, with conservation of both gene order and imprinted features. We report here the characterization of a transgene insertion (Epstein-Barr virus Latent Membrane Protein 2A, LMP2A) into mouse chromosome 7C, which has resulted in mouse models for PWS and AS dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent. Epigenotype (allelic expression and DNA methylation) and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses indicate that the transgene-induced mutation has generated a complete deletion of the PWS/AS-homologous region but has not deleted flanking loci. Because the intact chromosome 7, opposite the deleted homolog, maintains the correct imprint in somatic cells of PWS and AS mice and establishes the correct imprint in male and female germ cells of AS mice, homologous association and replication asynchrony are not part of the imprinting mechanism. This heritable-deletion mouse model will be particularly useful for the identification of the etiological genes and mechanisms, phenotypic basis, and investigation of therapeutic approaches for PWS..

The human MAGEL2 gene and its mouse homologue are paternally expressed and mapped to the Prader-Willi region.
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex neurogenetic disorder. The phenotype is likely to be a contiguous gene syndrome involving genes which are paternally expressed only, located in the human 15q11-q13 region. Four mouse models of PWS have been reported but these do not definitively allow the delineation of the critical region and the associated genes involved in the aetiology of PWS. Moreover, targeted mutagenesis of mouse homologues of the human candidate PWS genes does not appear to result in any of the features of PWS. Therefore, the isolation of new genes in this region remains crucial for a better understanding of the molecular basis of PWS. In this manuscript, we report the characterization of MAGEL2 and its mouse homologue Magel2. These are located in the human 15q11-q13 and mouse 7C regions, in close proximity to NDN/Ndn. By northern blot analysis we did not detect any expression of MAGEL2/Magel2 but by RT-PCR analysis, specific expression was detected in fetal and adult brain and in placenta. Both genes are intronless with tandem direct repeat sequences contained within a CpG island in the 5-untranscribed region. The transcripts encode putative proteins that are homologous to the MAGE proteins and NDN. Moreover, MAGEL2/Magel2 are expressed only from the paternal allele in brain, suggesting a potential role in the aetiology of PWS and its mouse model, respectively..

A de novo unbalanced reciprocal translocation identified as paternal in origin in the Prader-Willi syndrome.
Interstitial cytogenetic deletions involving the paternally derived chromosome 15q11-13 have been described in patients with the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We report a child with PWS and a de novo unbalanced karyotype -45, XY, -9, -15, + der (9) t (9; 15) (q34; q13). Molecular studies with the DNA probe pML34 confirmed that only a single Prader Willi critical region (PWCR  15q11. 2-q12) copy was present. Hybridisation of patient and parental DNA with the multi-allelic probe CMW1, which maps to pter-15q13, showed that the chromosome involved in the translocation was paternal in origin. This is the first example of a paternally-derived PWCR allele loss caused by an unbalanced translocation that has arisen de novo.

Difference in methylation patterns within the D15S9 region of chromosome 15q11-13 in first cousins with Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome.
Abnormalities of chromosome region 15q11-13 are associated with Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Differences between the methylation patterns of the region of chromosome 15q11-13 which hybridizes to the highly conserved DNA, DN34, in normal individuals and in patients with AS and PWS have been described. We report on a family in which first cousins are affected by AS and PWS as a result of a familial paracentric inversion of 15q11-q13. The results of the studies on this family demonstrate the differences in the methylation patterns in the 2 conditions and the phenomenon of genomic imprinting, whereby genetic information is expressed differently dependent on the parent of origin..

Hypopigmentation in the Prader-Willi syndrome.
Cutaneous and ocular pigmentation were evaluated in 29 individuals with the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Criteria for hypopigmentation included the presence of type I or II skin, the lightest skin type in the family by history, and iris translucency on globe transillumination. On the basis of these criteria, 48% of the PWS individuals were hypopigmented. The presence of hypopigmentation correlated with a small interstitial deletion on the proximal long arm of chromosome 15; however, this deletion was also found in individuals who did not meet the full criteria for hypopigmentation. Hairbulb tyrosinase activity and glutathione content, as well as urine cysteinyldopa excretion, were low in PWS individuals with and without hypopigmentation and did not separate these two groups. We conclude that hypopigmentation is found in a significant proportion of individuals with PWS and that the hypopigmentation may be associated with a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15. The mechanism for the hypopigmentation is unknown..

Chromosome breakage in the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes involves recombination between large, transcribed repeats at proximal and distal breakpoints.
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are distinct neurobehavioral disorders that most often arise from a 4-Mb deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 during paternal or maternal gametogenesis, respectively. At a de novo frequency of approximately. 67-1/10, 000 births, these deletions represent a common structural chromosome change in the human genome. To elucidate the mechanism underlying these events, we characterized the regions that contain two proximal breakpoint clusters and a distal cluster. Novel DNA sequences potentially associated with the breakpoints were positionally cloned from YACs within or near these regions. Analyses of rodent-human somatic-cell hybrids, YAC contigs, and FISH of normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences (the END repeats) at or near the breakpoints. The END-repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a novel gene (HERC2), many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germline tissues. One of five PWS/AS patients analyzed to date has an identifiable, rearranged HERC2 transcript derived from the deletion event. We postulate that the END repeats flanking 15q11-q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting in deletion. Furthermore, we propose that active transcription of these repeats in male and female germ cells may facilitate the homologous recombination process.

Isolation of molecular probes associated with the chromosome 15 instability in the Prader-Willi syndrome.
Flow cytometry and recombinant DNA techniques have been used to obtain reagents for a molecular analysis of the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). HindIII total-digest libraries were prepared in lambda phage Charon 21A from flow-sorted inverted duplicated no. 15 human chromosomes and propagated on recombination-proficient (LE392) and recBC-, sbcB- (DB1257) bacteria. Twelve distinct chromosome 15-specific probes have been isolated. Eight localized to the region 15q11----13. Four of these eight sublocalized to band 15q11. 2 and are shown to be deleted in DNA of one of two patients examined with the PWS. Heteroduplex analysis of two of these clones, which grew on DB1257 but not on LE392, revealed stem-loop structures in the inserts, indicative of inverted, repeated DNA elements. Such DNA repeats might account for some of the cloning instability of DNA segments from proximal 15q. Analysis of the genetic and physical instability associated with the repeated sequences we have isolated from band 15q11. 2 may elucidate the molecular basis for the instability of this chromosomal region in patients with the PWS or other diseases associated with chromosomal abnormalities in the proximal long arm of human chromosome 15

De novo deletions of SNRPN exon 1 in early human and mouse embryos result in a paternal to maternal imprint switch.
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurogenetic disease characterized by infantile hypotonia, gonadal hypoplasia, obsessive behaviour and neonatal feeding difficulties followed by hyperphagia, leading to profound obesity. PWS is due to a lack of paternal genetic information at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). Five imprinted, paternally expressed genes map to the PWS region, MKRN3 (ref. 3), NDN (ref. 4), NDNL1 (ref. 5), SNRPN (refs 6-8) and IPW (ref. 9), as well as two poorly characterized framents designated PAR-1 and PAR-5 (ref. 10). Imprinting of this region involves a bipartite imprinting centre (IC), which overlaps SNRPN (refs 10, 11). Deletion of the SNRPN promoter/exon 1 region (the PWS IC element) appears to impair the establishment of the paternal imprint in the male germ line and leads to PWS. Here we report a PWS family in which the father is mosaic for an IC deletion on his paternal chromosome. The deletion chromosome has acquired a maternal methylation imprint in his somatic cells. We have made identical findings in chimaeric mice generated from two independent embryonic stem (ES) cell lines harbouring a similar deletion. Our studies demonstrate that the PWS IC element is not only required for the establishment of the paternal imprint, but also for its postzygotic maintenance..
