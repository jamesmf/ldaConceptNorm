Mutational analysis and genotype-phenotype correlation of 29 unrelated Japanese patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.
BACKGROUND  X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an inherited disease characterized by progressive neurologic dysfunction, occasionally associated with adrenal insufficiency. The classic form of ALD usually has onset in childhood (childhood cerebral ALD), with rapid neurologic deterioration leading to a vegetative state. Adult-onset cerebral ALD also presents with rapidly progressive neurologic dysfunction. Milder phenotypes such as adrenomyeloneuropathy and Addison disease only also have been recognized. Despite discovery of the causative gene, a molecular basis for the diverse clinical presentations remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES  To conduct mutational analyses in 29 Japanese patients with ALD from 29 unrelated families, to obtain knowledge of the spectrum of mutations in this gene, and to study genotype-phenotype correlations in Japanese patients. METHODS  The 29 patients comprised 13 patients with childhood cerebral ALD, 11 patients with adult-onset cerebral ALD, and 5 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy. We conducted detailed mutational analyses of 29 unrelated Japanese patients with ALD by genomic Southern blot analysis and direct nucleotide sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction products derived from total RNA that was extracted from cultured skin fibroblasts, lymphoblastoid cells, or peripheral blood leukocytes. RESULTS  Three patients with adult-onset cerebral ALD were identified as having large genomic rearrangements. The remaining 26 patients were identified as having 21 independent mutations, including 12 novel mutations resulting in small nucleotide alterations in the ALD gene. Eighteen (69%) of 26 mutations were missense mutations. Most missense mutations involved amino acids conserved in homologous gene products, including PMP70, mALDRP, and Pxa1p. The AG dinucleotide deletion at position 1081-1082, which has been reported previously to be the most common mutation in white patients (12% -17%), was also identified as the most common mutation in Japanese patients (12%). All phenotypes were associated with mutations resulting in protein truncation or subtle amino acid changes. There were no differences in phenotypic expressions between missense mutations involving conserved amino acids and those involving nonconserved amino acids. CONCLUSIONS  There are no obvious correlations between the phenotypes of patients with ALD and their genotypes, suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors modify the phenotypic expressions of ALD..

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD): a novel mutation of the ALD gene in 6 members of a family presenting with 5 different phenotypes.
Fragments of the adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) cDNA from a patient with adolescent ALD were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned. Bidirectional sequencing of the entire coding ALD gene disclosed a cytosine to guanine transversion at nucleotide 1451 in exon five, resulting in substitution of proline 484 by arginine. Five of nine siblings of the patient, comprising two cerebral ALD, one adrenomyeloneuropathy, one Addison only as well as the symptomatic mother (all accumulating very long chain fatty acids) carried this mutation, which was not found in the unaffected persons, in five unrelated ALD patients, and in twenty controls. We propose that this missense mutation generated the disease per se as well as the metabolic defect; the different phenotypes, however, must have originated by means of additional pathogenetic factors..

Adrenoleukodystrophy: survey of 303 cases: biochemistry, diagnosis, and therapy.
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a genetically determined disorder associated with progressive central demyelination and adrenal cortical insufficiency. All affected persons show increased levels of saturated unbranched very-long-chain fatty acids, particularly hexacosanoate (C26  0), because of impaired capacity to degrade these acids. This degradation normally takes place in a subcellular organelle called the peroxisome, and ALD, together with Zellwegers cerebrohepatorenal syndrome, is now considered to belong to the newly formed category of peroxisomal disorders. Biochemical assays permit prenatal diagnosis, as well as identification of most heterozygotes. We have identified 303 patients with ALD in 217 kindreds. These patients show a wide phenotypic variation. Sixty percent of patients had childhood ALD and 17% adrenomyeloneuropathy, both of which are X-linked, with the gene mapped to Xq28. Neonatal ALD, a distinct entity with autosomal recessive inheritance and points of resemblance to Zellwegers syndrome, accounted for 7% of the cases. Although excess C26  0 in the brain of patients with ALD is partially of dietary origin, dietary C26  0 restriction did not produce clear benefit. Bone marrow transplant lowered the plasma C26  0 level but failed to arrest neurological progression..

Adrenoleukodystrophy: increased plasma content of saturated very long chain fatty acids.
With a new method we measured the saturated very long chain fatty acids in the plasma of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) hemizygotes, ALD heterozygotes, and controls. ALD hemizygotes showed increased levels of hexacosanoate (C26 fatty acid) which represented 0. 081 +/- 0. 0066% (SEM) of total fatty acids, compared to 0. 015 +/- 0. 0032% in the controls. C25, C24, and C23 fatty acids were also increased, but the C22 and C20 fatty acids were normal. C26 levels were also increased in most ALD heterozygotes, with a mean level 0. 057 +/- 0. 0063% of total fatty acids. The technique can be used for diagnosis and carrier identification, and in the evaluation of therapy.

Putative X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy gene shares unexpected homology with ABC transporters.
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an X-linked disease affecting 1/20, 000 males either as cerebral ALD in childhood or as adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) in adults. Childhood ALD is the more severe form, with onset of neurological symptoms between 5-12 years of age. Central nervous system demyelination progresses rapidly and death occurs within a few years. AMN is a milder form of the disease with onset at 15-30 years of age and a more progressive course. Adrenal insufficiency (Addisons disease) may remain the only clinical manifestation of ALD. The principal biochemical abnormality of ALD is the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) because of impaired beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. The normal oxidation of VLCFA-CoA in patients fibroblasts suggested that the gene coding for the VLCFA-CoA synthetase could be a candidate gene for ALD. Here we use positional cloning to identify a gene partially deleted in 6 of 85 independent patients with ALD. In familial cases, the deletions segregated with the disease. An identical deletion was detected in two brothers presenting with different clinical ALD phenotypes. Candidate exons were identified by computer analysis of genomic sequences and used to isolate complementary DNAs by exon connection and screening of cDNA libraries. The deduced protein sequence shows significant sequence identity to a peroxisomal membrane protein of M (r) 70K that is involved in peroxisome biogenesis and belongs to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters..

Linkage of DNA markers at Xq28 to adrenoleukodystrophy and adrenomyeloneuropathy present within the same family.
We present a large kindred that contained patients with either adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) or adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). The pedigree clearly supported the X-linked mode of inheritance of the nonneonatal form of ALD/AMN. Analysis with DNA markers at Xq28 suggested segregation of both ALD and AMN with an identical haplotype. This indicated that nonneonatal ALD and AMN are caused by a mutation in the same gene at Xq28. It showed, furthermore, that phenotypic differences between ALD and AMN are not necessarily the consequence of allelic heterogeneity due to different mutations within the same gene. The maximal lod score for linkage of the ALD/AMN gene and the multiallelic anonymous DNA marker at DXS52 was 3. 0 at a recombination fraction of 0. 00. This made a prenatal or presymptomatic diagnosis and heterozygote detection by DNA analysis with this marker reliable.

Adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein can compensate functionally for adrenoleukodystrophy protein deficiency (X-ALD): implications for therapy.
Inherited defects in the peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) lead to the lethal peroxisomal disorder X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), for which no efficient treatment has been established so far. Three other peroxisomal ABC transporters currently are known  adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein (ALDRP), 70 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70) and PMP70- related protein. By using transient and stable overexpression of human cDNAs encoding ALDP and its closest relative ALDRP, we could restore the impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation in fibroblasts of X-ALD patients. The pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids could also be prevented by overexpression of ALDRP in immortalized X-ALD cells. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the functional replacement of ALDP by ALDRP was not due to stabilization of the mutated ALDP itself. Moreover, we were able to restore the peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect in the liver of ALDP-deficient mice by stimulation of ALDRP and PMP70 gene expression through a dietary treatment with the peroxisome proliferator fenofibrate. These results suggest that a correction of the biochemical defect in X-ALD could be possible by drug-induced overexpression or ectopic expression of ALDRP..

Linkage analysis in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and application in post- and prenatal diagnosis.
We have performed linkage analysis with the DNA markers DXS52 and the clotting factor VIII gene (F8C), in several large families with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). The tight linkage to DXS52 could be extended giving a maximal LOD score of 22. 5 at 1 cM. F8C was also tightly linked to ALD with a maximal LOD score of 7. 8 without recombination. Multipoint linkage analysis with the markers DXS304, DXS52, and F8C indicated that both the gene for ALD and for F8C are distal to DXS52. In four patients with ALD, no major structural rearrangement in the Xqter region was observed; in particular, there were no abnormalities in the vision blindness genes. DNA analysis appeared to be of use in determination of the carrier status of females at risk, for the determination of the origin of the mutation in a particular family, and for prenatal diagnosis.

Genomic organization of the adrenoleukodystrophy gene.
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), the most frequent peroxisomal disorder, is a severe neurodegenerative disease associated with an impairment of very long chain fatty acids beta-oxidation. We have recently identified by positional cloning the gene responsible for ALD, located in Xq28. It encodes a new member of the " ABC " superfamily of membrane-associated transporters that shows, in particular, significant homology to the 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70). We report here a detailed characterization of the ALD gene structure. It extends over 21 kb and consists of 10 exons. To facilitate the detection of mutations in ALD patients, we have determined the intronic sequences flanking the exons as well as the sequence of the 3 untranslated region and of the immediate 5 promoter region. Sequences present in distal exons cross-hybridize strongly to additional sequences in the human genome. The ALD gene has been positioned on a pulsed-field map between DXS15 and the L1CAM gene, about 650 kb upstream from the color pigment genes. The frequent occurrence of color vision anomalies observed in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (the adult onset form of ALD) thus does not represent a contiguous gene syndrome but a secondary manifestation of ALD..

Phenotype heterogeneity among hemizygotes in a family biochemically screened for adrenoleukodystrophy.
We report on two clinically, neurologically normal relatives of a boy affected by adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD); they were found repeatedly to have the biochemical defect of an ALD hemizygote. The assay consisted in the determination of very-long-chain fatty acids in lyophilized and reconstituted plasma. While no evidence of neurologic disease (leukodystrophy or myeloneuropathy) was present in these hemizygotes, adrenocortical insufficiency provoking compensatory high ACTH release was found in both. These findings should be taken into consideration when counseling families in which cases with clinically expressed ALD are represented in several generations..

Predominance of the adrenomyeloneuropathy phenotype of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in The Netherlands: a survey of 30 kindreds.
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited disorder of peroxisomal beta-oxidation associated with accumulation of saturated very long-chain fatty acids, which results in central and peripheral demyelination and in impaired function of adrenal cortex and testes. The phenotypic expression is highly variable, childhood cerebral ALD (CCALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) being the main variants. We explored the 30 Dutch kindreds well known to the Dutch X-ALD/AMN Study Group and phenotyped 77 male patients  35 (46%) had AMN and 24 (31%) CCALD or adolescent cerebral ALD (AdolCALD). These percentages differ significantly from previous reports, in which 25 to 28% of the patients developed AMN and 53 to 57% CCALD or AdolCALD. Our findings indicate that--at least in the Netherlands--AMN may be the most frequent phenotype of X-ALD..

Adrenoleukodystrophy and adrenomyeloneuropathy associated with partial adrenal insufficiency in three generations of a kindred.
Four cases of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and one case of adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) have developed in a kindred over three generations demonstrating that AMN is a clinical variant of ALD. Pituitary-adrenal function studies were performed in 10 family members, including two affected males and four females identified as carriers of ALD/AMN. No pituitary-adrenal abnormality was found in the carriers. However, basal morning plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels were markedly elevated in the two males with ALD and AMN, despite the fact that they had no clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency and that morning plasma cortisol levels and their response to maximal exogenous ACTH stimulation appeared to be normal. In addition, the integrated 24-hour response to the administration were also subnormal in these two cases. Thus, people with ALD and AMN may have subclinical partial adrenocrotical insufficiency. No other endocrinologic dysfunction was identified..

Identification of mutations in the ALD-gene of 20 families with adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy.
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), an X-linked inherited metabolic disorder, is the most frequent inborn peroxisomal disease. It leads to demyelination in the central and peripheral nervous system. Defective beta-oxidation of saturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs; C22  0-C26  0) in peroxisomes has been shown to lead to an accumulation of VLCFAs in leukoid areas of the central nervous system, peripheral nerves, adrenal gland, and blood. The ALD gene has been recently identified and encodes a 745-amino-acid protein. We screened patients with adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy (ALD/AMN) from 20 kindreds for mutations in the ALD gene. Eleven missense and two nonsense mutations, five deletions, and one insertion were detected by direct sequencing of eight reverse transcribed fragments of the ALD-gene mRNA. Four mutations could be shown to be de novo. All mutations could be confirmed in carriers by sequencing genomic DNA. No correlation between the type of mutation and the severity of the phenotype could be observed. The mutations were not detected in the ALD gene of 30 healthy persons..

Color vision defects in adrenomyeloneuropathy.
The relationship between abnormal color vision and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) was investigated in 27 AMN patients and 31 age-matched controls by using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test. Twelve (44%) of 27 patients showed test scores significantly above normal. The axes of bipolarity determined by the testing differed widely between the patients with abnormal scores, compatible with the notion that different alterations in visual pigment genes occur in different AMN kindreds. These observations confirm our earlier impression that the frequency of abnormal color vision is increased in these kindreds, and it supports our contentions that (1) AMN (and its companion, adrenoleukodystrophy) are very closely linked to the visual pigment loci at Xq28 and (2) this proximity might provide the opportunity to observe contiguous gene defects..

The red-green visual pigment gene region in adrenoleukodystrophy.
Although recent data established that a specific very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase is defective in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), the ALD gene is still unidentified. The ALD locus has been mapped to Xq28, like the red and green color pigment genes. Abnormal color vision has been observed in 12 of 27 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), a milder form of ALD. Furthermore, rearrangements of the color vision gene cluster were found in four of eight ALD kindreds. This led us to propose that a single DNA rearrangement could underlie both ALD and abnormal color vision in these patients. Study of 34 French ALD patients failed to reveal a higher than expected frequency of green/red visual pigment rearrangements 3 to the red/green color vision gene complex. The previous report of such rearrangements was based on small numbers and lack of knowledge that the frequency of " abnormal " color vision arrays on molecular analysis was twice as high as expected on the basis of the frequency of phenotypic color vision defects. The red/green color pigment (R/GCP) region was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 14 of these patients, and we did not find any fragment size difference between the patients and normal individuals who have the same number of pigment genes. The R/GCP region was also analyzed in 29 French and seven North American ALD patients by using six genomic DNA probes, isolated from a cosmid walk, that flank the color vision genes. No deletions were found with probes that lie 3 of the green pigment genes. One of the eight previously reported ALD individuals has a long deletion 5 of the red pigment gene, a deletion causing blue cone monochromacy. This finding and the previous findings of a 45% frequency of phenotypic color vision defects in patients with AMN may suggest that the ALD/AMN gene lies 5 to the red pigment gene and that the frequent phenotypic color vision anomalies owe their origin to deleted DNA that includes regulatory genes for color vision. It is possible, however, that phenotypic color vision anomalies in AMN may be phenocopies secondary to retinal or neural involvement by the disease. The single case of blue cone monochromacy may therefore be a fortuitous coincidence of two diseases..

A new CT pattern in adrenoleukodystrophy.
A new CT pattern was observed in 2 patients with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). This pattern, which the authors call Type II, is characterized by the absence of posterior periventricular areas of decreased attenuation around the trigone on non-contrast scans  after contrast infusion, however, there is striking enhancement of various white-matter structures (tracts or fiber systems) such as the internal capsules, corpus callosum, corona radiata, forceps major, and cerebral peduncles. This is different from numerous previous descriptions of the CT pattern in ALD. Type II ALD does not appear to have been seen in any other leukoencephalopathy and is probably specific for a phenotypic variant or an evolving stage of ALD..

Mutations in the gene for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in patients with different clinical phenotypes.
Recently, the gene for the most common peroxisomal disorder, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), has been described encoding a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein. We analyzed the entire protein-coding sequence of this gene by reverse-transcription PCR, SSCP, and DNA sequencing in five patients with different clinical expression of X-ALD and in their female relatives; these clinical expressions were cerebral childhood ALD, adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), and " Addison disease only " (ADO) phenotype. In the three patients exhibiting the classical picture of severe childhood ALD we identified in the 5 portion of the X-ALD gene a 38-bp deletion that causes a frameshift mutation, a 3-bp deletion leading to a deletion of an amino acid in the ATP-binding domain of the ALD protein, and a missense mutation. In the patient with the clinical phenotype of AMN, a nonsense mutation in codon 212, along with a second site mutation at codon 178, was observed. Analysis of the patient with the ADO phenotype revealed a further missense mutation at a highly conserved position in the ALDP/PMP70 comparison. The disruptive nature of two mutations (i. e., the frameshift and the nonsense mutation) in patients with biochemically proved childhood ALD and AMN further strongly supports the hypothesis that alterations in this gene play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of X-ALD. Since the current biochemical techniques for X-ALD carrier detection in affected families lack sufficient reliability, our procedure described for systematic mutation scanning is also capable of improving genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis

Determination of 30 X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy mutations, including 15 not previously described.
X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the most frequent peroxisomal disease. It mainly involves the nervous system white matter, adrenal cortex and testes. Several distinct clinical phenotypes are known. The principal biochemical abnormality is the accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs  > C22  0, mainly C26  0), which is due to impaired capacity for beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. Diagnosis is usually based on the VLCFA levels in plasma or cultured skin fibroblasts in both patients and carriers. In 0. 1% of affected males, however, the plasma C26  0 level is borderline normal, and 15% of obligate female carriers have normal results. Effective mutation detection in these families is therefore fundamental to unambiguously determine the genetic status of each individual at risk. Of particular concern are female members of kindreds segregating X-ALD mutations, because normal VLCFA levels do not guarantee lack of carrier status. We describe a fast method for detection of X-ALD mutations. The method is based on SSCP analysis of nested PCR fragments followed by sequence-determination reactions. Using this methodology we have found X-ALD mutations in 30 kindreds, including 15 not previously reported.

Adrenoleukodystrophy gene encodes an 80 kDa membrane protein.
An antibody against the synthetic C-terminal peptides deduced from the cDNA of the gene responsible for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) was produced to characterize the product of the ALD gene. The antibody reacted with the 80 kDa band protein in control fibroblasts, while no bands were detected in the fibroblasts from a patient with ALD (# 163), in which mRNA of the ALD gene was undetectable based on Northern blot analysis. The 293T cells transfected with the full-coding cDNA inserted in the expression vector produced a new 80 kDa protein, as detected by Western blot. In an immunocytological study, the staining was in a punctate pattern, in the normal fibroblasts. However, there was no punctate staining in the # 163 cells. These data thus indicate that the ALD gene encodes an 80 kDa membrane protein..

Bone marrow transplant in adrenoleukodystrophy.
An allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) from a normal HLA identical sibling donor was performed in a 13-year-old boy with rapidly progressive adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Engraftment and complete hematologic recovery occurred within 4 weeks, but neurologic deterioration continued. The patient died of an adenovirus infection 141 days after BMT. ALD is characterized by abnormally high plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) as a result of impaired capacity to degrade them. Ten days after BMT, the white blood cell VLCFA levels and enzyme activity became normal; after 3 months, there was progressive reduction of plasma VLCFA to levels only slightly above normal..

Neurophysiologic follow-up of long-term dietary treatment in adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy.
OBJECTIVE  To monitor the effects of dietary treatment in adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) by means of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs). BACKGROUND  SEPs and MEPs have proved useful in revealing signs of progressively severe, central dying-back axonopathy in early stages of adult-onset ALD. METHODS  Eight patients with adult-onset ALD underwent clinical examination, brain and spine MRI, and SEP and MEP studies before and after 3 years of Lorenzos oil dietary therapy. RESULTS  Before treatment, brain MRI was normal in five patients. Three of these patients had pure spinal SEP abnormalities and in the remaining two patients SEPs showed signs of involvement of both the spinal and cerebral somatosensory tracts. After treatment, the three patients with pure spinal abnormalities showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening, whereas the two patients with a more advanced stage of disease (exhibited by SEPs) showed substantially unchanged clinical and neurophysiologic features. The patients with abnormal brain MRI at the onset of treatment showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening. CONCLUSIONS  Lorenzos oil therapy had no effect on patients with evidence of inflammatory brain lesions. Moreover, in patients without clear signs of inflammatory damage, this treatment does not modify significantly the natural course of the disease. However, because effective treatments should begin before the onset of severe neurologic symptoms, SEPs and MEPs should be considered to evaluate the effectiveness of other experimental treatments in the patient with a negative brain MRI.
