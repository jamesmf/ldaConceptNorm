Germline BRCA1 alterations in a population-based series of ovarian cancer cases.
The objective of this study was to provide more accurate frequency estimates of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) germline alterations in the ovarian cancer population. To achieve this, we determined the prevalence of BRCA1 alterations in a population-based series of consecutive ovarian cancer cases. This is the first population-based ovarian cancer study reporting BRCA1 alterations derived from a comprehensive screen of the entire coding region. One hundred and seven ovarian cancer cases were analyzed for BRCA1 alterations using the RNase mismatch cleavage assay followed by direct sequencing. Two truncating mutations, 962del4 and 3600del11, were identified. Both patients had a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Several novel as well as previously reported uncharacterized variants were also identified, some of which were associated with a family history of cancer. The frequency distribution of common polymorphisms was determined in the 91 Caucasian cancer cases in this series and 24 sister controls using allele-specific amplification. The rare form of the Q356R polymorphism was significantly (P = 0. 03) associated with a family history of ovarian cancer, suggesting that this polymorphism may influence ovarian cancer risk. In summary, our data suggest a role for some uncharacterized variants and rare forms of polymorphisms in determining ovarian cancer risk, and highlight the necessity to screen for missense alterations as well as truncating mutations in this population.

BRCA1 mutations in a population-based sample of young women with breast cancer.
BACKGROUND. Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer in some families. However, little is known about the contribution of BRCA1 mutations to breast cancer in the general population. We analyzed DNA samples from women enrolled in a population-based study of early-onset breast cancer to assess the spectrum and frequency of germ-line BRCA1 mutations in young women with breast cancer. METHODS. We studied 80 women in whom breast cancer was diagnosed before the age of 35, and who were not selected on the basis of family history. Genomic DNA was studied for BRCA1 mutations by analysis involving single-strand conformation polymorphisms and with allele-specific assays. Alterations were defined by DNA sequencing. RESULTS. Germ-line BRCA1 mutations were identified in 6 of the 80 women. Four additional rare sequence variants of unknown functional importance were also identified. Two of the mutations and three of the rare sequence variants were found among the 39 women who reported no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. None of the mutations and only one of the rare variants was identified in a reference population of 73 unrelated subjects. CONCLUSIONS. Alterations in BRCA1 were identified in approximately 10 percent of this cohort of young women with breast cancer. The risk of harboring a mutation was not limited to women with family histories of breast or ovarian cancer. These results represent a minimal estimate of the frequency of BRCA1 mutations in this population. Comprehensive methods of identifying BRCA1 mutations and understanding their importance will be needed before testing of women in the general population can be undertaken..

Decreased expression of BRCA1 accelerates growth and is often present during sporadic breast cancer progression.
We have characterized expression of the familial breast and ovarian cancer gene, BRCA1, in cases of non-hereditary (sporadic) breast cancer and analyzed the effect of antisense inhibition of BRCA1 on the proliferative rate of mammary epithelial cells. BRCA1 mRNA levels are markedly decreased during the transition from carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer. Experimental inhibition of BRCA1 expression with antisense oligonucleotides produced accelerated growth of normal and malignant mammary cells, but had no effect on non-mammary epithelial cells. These studies suggest that BRCA1 may normally serve as a negative regulator of mammary epithelial cell growth whose function is compromised in breast cancer either by direct mutation or alterations in gene expression..

hCds1-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1 regulates the DNA damage response.
Mutations in the BRCA1 (ref. 1) tumour suppressor gene are found in almost all of the families with inherited breast and ovarian cancers and about half of the families with only breast cancer. Although the biochemical function of BRCA1 is not well understood, it is important for DNA damage repair and cell-cycle checkpoint. BRCA1 exists in nuclear foci but is hyperphosphorylated and disperses after DNA damage. It is not known whether BRCA1 phosphorylation and dispersion and its function in DNA damage response are related. In yeast the DNA damage response and the replication-block checkpoint are mediated partly through the Cds1 kinase family. Here we report that the human Cds1 kinase (hCds1/Chk2) regulates BRCA1 function after DNA damage by phosphorylating serine 988 of BRCA1. We show that hCds1 and BRCA1 interact and co-localize within discrete nuclear foci but separate after gamma irradiation. Phosphorylation of BRCA1 at serine 988 is required for the release of BRCA1 from hCds1. This phosphorylation is also important for the ability of BRCA1 to restore survival after DNA damage in the BRCA1-mutated cell line HCC1937..

A zinc finger truncation of murine WT1 results in the characteristic urogenital abnormalities of Denys-Drash syndrome .
The Wilms tumor -suppressor gene, WT1, plays a key role in urogenital development, and WT1 dysfunction is implicated in both neoplastic (Wilms tumor, mesothelioma, leukemias, and breast cancer) and nonneoplastic (glomerulosclerosis) disease. The analysis of diseases linked specifically with WT1 mutations, such as Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), can provide valuable insight concerning the role of WT1 in development and disease. DDS is a rare childhood disease characterized by a nephropathy involving mesangial sclerosis, XY pseudohermaphroditism, and/or Wilms tumor (WT). DDS patients are constitutionally heterozygous for exonic point mutations in WT1, which include mutations predicted to truncate the protein within the C-terminal zinc finger (ZF) region. We report that heterozygosity for a targeted murine Wt1 allele, Wt1 (tmT396), which truncates ZF3 at codon 396, induces mesangial sclerosis characteristic of DDS in adult heterozygous and chimeric mice. Male genital defects also were evident and there was a single case of Wilms tumor in which the transcript of the nontargeted allele showed an exon 9 skipping event, implying a causal link between Wt1 dysfunction and Wilms tumorigenesis in mice. However, the mutant WT1 (tmT396) protein accounted for only 5% of WT1 in both heterozygous embryonic stem cells and the WT. This has implications regarding the mechanism by which the mutant allele exerts its effect.

PRAD1, a candidate BCL1 oncogene: mapping and expression in centrocytic lymphoma.
Rearrangement of the BCL1 (B-cell lymphoma 1) region on chromosome 11q13 appears to be highly characteristic of centrocytic lymphoma and also is found infrequently in other B-cell neoplasms. Rearrangement is thought to deregulate a nearby protooncogene, but transcribed sequences in the immediate vicinity of BCL1 breakpoints had not been identified. PRAD1, previously designated D11S287E, was identified on 11q13 as a chromosomal breakpoint region rearranged with the parathyroid hormone gene in a subset of parathyroid adenomas; this highly conserved putative oncogene, which encodes a novel cyclin, has been linked to BCL1 and implicated also in subsets of breast and squamous cell neoplasms with 11q13 amplification. We report pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data showing BCL1 and PRAD1 to be no more than 130 kilobases apart. PRAD1 mRNA is abundantly expressed in seven of seven centrocytic lymphomas (Kiel classification), in contrast to 13 closely related but noncentrocytic lymphomas. Three of the seven centrocytic lymphomas had detectable BCL1 DNA rearrangement. Also, two unusual cases of CLL with BCL1 rearrangement overexpressed PRAD1, in contrast to five CLL controls. Thus, PRAD1 is an excellent candidate " BCL1 oncogene. " Its overexpression may be a key consequence of rearrangement of the BCL1 vicinity in B-cell neoplasms and a unifying pathogenetic feature in centrocytic lymphoma.

Association of BRCA1 with the hRad50-hMre11-p95 complex and the DNA damage response.
BRCA1 encodes a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancers. Here, it is shown that BRCA1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with hRad50, which forms a complex with hMre11 and p95/nibrin. Upon irradiation, BRCA1 was detected in discrete foci in the nucleus, which colocalize with hRad50. Formation of irradiation-induced foci positive for BRCA1, hRad50, hMre11, or p95 was dramatically reduced in HCC/1937 breast cancer cells carrying a homozygous mutation in BRCA1 but was restored by transfection of wild-type BRCA1. Ectopic expression of wild-type, but not mutated, BRCA1 in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the DNA damage agent, methyl methanesulfonate. These data suggest that BRCA1 is important for the cellular responses to DNA damage that are mediated by the hRad50-hMre11-p95 complex..

ATM-heterozygous germline mutations contribute to breast cancer-susceptibility.
Approximately 0. 5% -1% of the general population has been estimated to be heterozygous for a germline mutation in the ATM gene. Mutations in the ATM gene are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) (MIM 208900). The finding that ATM-heterozygotes have an increased relative risk for breast cancer was supported by some studies but not confirmed by others. In view of this discrepancy, we examined the frequency of ATM germline mutations in a selected group of Dutch patients with breast cancer. We have analyzed ATM germline mutations in normal blood lymphocytes, using the protein-truncation test followed by genomic-sequence analysis. A high percentage of ATM germline mutations was demonstrated among patients with sporadic breast cancer. The 82 patients included in this study had developed breast cancer at age < 45 and had survived >/= 5 years (mean 15 years), and in 33 (40%) of the patients a contralateral breast tumor had been diagnosed. Among these patients we identified seven (8. 5%) ATM germline mutations, of which five are distinct. One splice-site mutation (IVS10-6T-- > G) was detected three times in our series. Four heterozygous carriers were patients with bilateral breast cancer. Our results indicate that the mutations identified in this study are " A-T disease-causing " mutations that might be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in heterozygotes. We conclude that ATM heterozygotes have an approximately ninefold-increased risk of developing a type of breast cancer characterized by frequent bilateral occurrence, early age at onset, and long-term survival. The specific characteristics of our population of patients may explain why such a high frequency was not found in other series.

A physical map and candidate genes in the BRCA1 region on chromosome 17q12-21.
We have constructed a physical map of a 4 cM region on chromosome 17q12-21 that contains the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene BRCA1. The map comprises a contig of 137 overlapping yeast artificial chromosomes and P1 clones, onto which we have placed 112 PCR markers. We have localized more than 20 genes on this map, ten of which had not been mapped to the region previously, and have isolated 30 cDNA clones representing partial sequences of as yet unidentified genes. Two genes that lie within a narrow region defined by meiotic breakpoints in BRCA1 patients have been sequenced in breast cancer patients without revealing any deleterious mutations. These new reagents should facilitate the identification of BRCA1..

Germline mutations of the BRCA1 gene in breast and ovarian cancer families provide evidence for a genotype-phenotype correlation.
Mutations in the BRCA1 gene, discovered in 1994, are associated with an 80-90% lifetime risk of breast cancer. We have analysed 60 families with a history of breast and/or ovarian cancer for germline mutations in BRCA1. Twenty-two different mutations were detected in 32 families (53%), of which 14 are previously unreported. We observed a significant correlation between the location of the mutation in the gene and the ratio of breast to ovarian cancer incidence within each family. Our data suggest a transition in risk such that mutations in the 3 third of the gene are associated with a lower proportion of ovarian cancer. Haplotype analysis supports previous data which suggest some BRCA1 mutation carriers have common ancestors; however, we have found at least two examples where recurrent mutations appear to have arisen independently..

Linkage analysis of 26 Canadian breast and breast-ovarian cancer families.
We have examined 26 Canadian families with hereditary breast or ovarian cancer for linkage to markers flanking the BRCA1 gene on chromosome 17q12-q21. Of the 15 families that contain cases of ovarian cancer, 94% were estimated to be linked to BRCA1. In contrast, there was no overall evidence of linkage in the group of 10 families with breast cancer without ovarian cancer. A genetic recombinant in a breast-ovarian cancer family indicates a placement of BRCA1 telomeric to D17S776, and helps to define the region of assignment of the cancer susceptibility gene. Other cancers of interest that appeared in the BRCA1-linked families included primary peritoneal cancer, cancer of the fallopian tube, and malignant melanoma..

Malignant neoplasms in the families of patients with ataxia-telangiectasia.
Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive syndrome associated with a greatly increased incidence of malignant neoplasms in homozygous affected individuals. Heterozygotes for the gene for A-T are thought to comprise about 1% of the general population and, therefore, it is important to know whether this gene also predisposes the heterozygous carrier to cancers. Heterozygous carriers of this gene are common among the close relatives of patients with A-T, although individual carriers cannot be identified by any clinical criterion or laboratory test. For this reason, we compared the incidence of death from malignant neoplasms in 2 families of patients with A-T to that expected in a random sample of the general population. There were 59 deaths from malignant neoplasms in relatives dying before age 75, compared to 42. 6 expected (p less than 0. 02). For A-T heterozygotes younger than age 45, the risk of dying from a malignant neoplasm was estimated to be greater than 5 times the risk for the general population. A-T heterozygotes may comprise more than 5% of all persons dying from a cancer before age 45. The incidence of ovarian, gastric, and biliary system carcinomas and of leukemia and lymphoma was increased in these A-T families. Other neoplasms that may be associated with this gene in heterozygotes include pancreatic, basal cell, colonic, breast, and cervical carcinomas.

Growth retardation and tumour inhibition by BRCA1.
Inherited mutations in BRCA1 predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, but the role of BRCA1 in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer has previously been elusive. Here, we show that retroviral transfer of the wild-type BRCA1 gene inhibits growth in vitro of all breast and ovarian cancer cell lines tested, but not colon or lung cancer cells or fibroblasts. Mutant BRCA1 has no effect on growth of breast cancer cells; ovarian cancer cell growth is not affected by BRCA1 mutations in the 5 portion of the gene, but is inhibited by 3 BRCA1 mutations. Development of MCF-7 tumours in nude mice is inhibited when MCF-7 cells are transfected with wild-type, but not mutant, BRCA1. Most importantly, among mice with established MCF-7 tumours, peritoneal treatment with a retroviral vector expressing wild-type BRCA1 significantly inhibits tumour growth and increased survival..

Rapid detection of BRCA1 mutations by the protein truncation test.
More than 75% of the reported mutations in the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene, BRCA1, result in truncated proteins. We have used the protein truncation test (PTT) to screen for mutations in exon 11, which encodes 61% of BRCA1. In 45 patients from breast and/or ovarian cancer families we found six novel mutations  two single nucleotide insertions, three small deletions (1-5 bp) and a nonsense mutation identified two unrelated families. Furthermore, we were able to amplify the remaining coding region by RT-PCR using lymphocyte RNA. Combined with PTT, we detected aberrantly spliced products affecting exons 5 and 6 in one of two BRCA1-linked families examined. The protein truncation test promises to become a valuable technique in detecting BRCA1 mutations..

Spectrum of hSNF5/INI1 somatic mutations in human cancer and genotype-phenotype correlations.
The hSNF5/INI1 gene which encodes a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin ATP-dependent remodeling complex, is a new tumor suppressor gene localized on chromosome 22q11. 2 and recently shown to be mutated in malignant rhabdoid tumors. We have searched for hSNF5/INI1 mutations in 229 tumors of various origins using a screening method based on denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. A total of 31 homozygous deletions and 36 point alterations were identified. Point mutations were scattered along the coding sequence and included 15 nonsense, 15 frameshift, three splice site, two missense and one editing mutations. Mutations were retrieved in most rhabdoid tumors, whatever their sites of occurrence, indicating the common pathogenetic origin of these tumors. Recurrent hSNF5/INI1 alterations were also observed in choroid plexus carcinomas and in a subset of central primitive neuroectodermal tumors (cPNETs) and medulloblastomas. In contrast, hSNF5/INI1 point mutations were not detected in breast cancers, Wilms tumors, gliomas, ependymomas, sarcomas and other tumor types, even though most analyzed cases harbored loss of heterozygosity at 22q11. 2 loci. These results suggest that rhabdoid tumors, choroid plexus carcinomas and a subset of medulloblastomas and cPNETs share common pathways of oncogenesis related to hSNF5/INI1 alteration and that hSNF5/INI1 mutations define a genetically homogeneous family of highly aggressive cancers mainly occurring in young children and frequently, but not always, exhibiting a rhabdoid phenotype

The carrier frequency of the BRCA1 185delAG mutation is approximately 1 percent in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals.
Since BRCA1, the first major gene responsible for inherited breast cancer, was cloned, more than 50 unique mutations have been detected in the germline of individuals with breast and ovarian cancer. In high-risk pedigrees, female carriers of BRCA1 mutations have an 80-90% lifetime risk of breast cancer, and a 40-50% risk of ovarian cancer. However, the mutation stats of individuals unselected for breast or ovarian cancer has not been determined, and it is not known whether mutations in such individuals confer the same risk of cancer as in individuals from the high-risk families studied so far. Following the finding of a 185delAG frameshift mutation in several Ashkenazi Jewish breast/ovarian families, we have determined the frequency of this mutation in 858 Ashkenazim seeking genetic testing for conditions unrelated to cancer, and in 815 reference individuals not selected for ethnic origin. We observed the 185delAG mutation in 0. 9% of Ashkenazim (95% confidence limit, 0. 4-1. 8%) and in none of the reference samples. Our results suggest that one in a hundred women of Ashkenazi descent may be at especially high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer.

Common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 do not contribute to early prostate cancer in Jewish men.
BACKGROUND  Families with a high incidence of hereditary breast cancer, and subsequently shown to have terminating mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, appear to have a higher incidence of prostate cancer among male relatives. We aimed to determine whether the common germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in Ashkenazi Jewish men predisposed them to prostate cancer. METHODS  We examined genomic DNA from 83 (for BRCA1 185delAG) or 82 (for BRCA2 6174delT) Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients, most of whom were treated at a relatively young age, for the most common germline mutation in each gene seen in the Ashkenazi population. RESULTS  Our study should have been able to detect a 4-5-fold increase in the risk of prostate cancer due to mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2. However, only one (1. 15%; 95% confidence interval, 0-3. 6%) of the patients was heterozygous for the BRCA1 mutant allele, and only two were heterozygous for the BRCA2 mutation (2. 4%; 95% confidence interval, 0-6. 2%). CONCLUSIONS  The incidence of each of the germline mutations in these prostate cancer patients closely matched their incidence (about 1%) in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population. This suggests that unlike cases of breast and ovarian cancers, mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 do not significantly predispose men to prostate cancer

Novel inherited mutations and variable expressivity of BRCA1 alleles, including the founder mutation 185delAG in Ashkenazi Jewish families.
Thirty-seven families with four or more cases of breast cancer or breast and ovarian cancer were analyzed for mutations in BRCA1. Twelve different germ-line mutations, four novel and eight previously observed, were detected in 16 families. Five families of Ashkenazi Jewish descent carried the 185delAG mutation and shared the same haplotype at eight polymorphic markers spanning approximately 850 kb at BRCA1. Expressivity of 185delAG in these families varied, from early-onset breast cancer without ovarian cancer. Mutation 4184delTCAA occurred independently in two families. In one family, penetrance was complete, with females developing early-onset breast cancer or ovarian cancer and the male carrier developing prostatic cancer, whereas, in the other family, penetrance was incomplete and only breast cancer occurred, diagnosed at ages 38-81 years. Two novel nonsense mutations led to the loss of mutant BRCA1 transcript in families with 10 and 6 cases of early-onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer. A 665-nt segment of the BRCA1 3-UTR and 1. 3 kb of genomic sequence including the putative promoter region were invariant by single-strand conformation analysis in 13 families without coding-sequence mutations. Overall in our series, BRCA1 mutations have been detected in 26 families  16 with positive BRCA1 lod scores, 7 with negative lod scores (reflecting multiple sporadic breast cancers), and 3 not tested for linkage. Three other families have positive lod scores for linkage to BRCA2, but 13 families without detected BRCA1 mutations have negative lod scores for both BRCA1 and BRCA2.

Aberrant subcellular localization of BRCA1 in breast cancer.
The BRCA1 gene product was identified as a 220-kilodalton nuclear phosphoprotein in normal cells, including breast ductal epithelial cells, and in 18 of 20 tumor cell lines derived from tissues other than breast and ovary. In 16 of 17 breast and ovarian cancer lines and 17 of 17 samples of cells obtained from malignant effusions, however, BRCA1 localized mainly in cytoplasm. Absence of BRCA1 or aberrant subcellular location was also observed to a variable extent in histological sections of many breast cancer biopsies. These findings suggest that BRCA1 abnormalities may be involved in the pathogenesis of many breast cancers, sporadic as well as familial..

Familial male breast cancer is not linked to the BRCA1 locus on chromosome 17q.
Breast cancer in men is about a hundredfold less common than in women and this has hindered research into its genetic basis. We have examined 22 families with at least one case of male breast cancer for linkage to the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer locus, BRCA1, on chromosome 17q. We found strong evidence against linkage to BRCA1 (lod score-16. 63) and the best estimate of the proportion of linked families was 0% (95% CI 0-18%). Our results indicate that there is a gene (s) other than BRCA1 which predisposes to early-onset breast cancer in women and which confers a higher risk of male breast cancer. Identification of additional pedigrees that include cases of male breast cancer may therefore facilitate the mapping and isolation of this gene.

Age at diagnosis as an indicator of eligibility for BRCA1 DNA testing in familial breast cancer.
We searched for criteria that could indicate breast cancer families with a high prior probability of being caused by the breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility locus BRCA1 on chromosome 17. To this end, we performed a linkage study with 59 consecutively collected Dutch breast cancer families, including 16 with at least one case of ovarian cancer. We used an intake cut-off of at least three first-degree relatives with breast and/or ovarian cancer at any age. Significant evidence for linkage was found only among the 13 breast cancer families with a mean age at diagnosis of less than 45 years. An unexpectedly low proportion of the breast-ovarian cancer families were estimated to be linked to BRCA1, which could be due to a founder effect in the Dutch population. Given the expected logistical problems in clinical management now that BRCA1 has been identified, we propose an interim period in which only families with a strong positive family history for early onset breast and/or ovarian cancer will be offered BRCA1 mutation testing..

An evaluation of genetic heterogeneity in 145 breast-ovarian cancer families. Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium.
The breast-ovary cancer-family syndrome is a dominant predisposition to cancer of the breast and ovaries which has been mapped to chromosome region 17q12-q21. The majority, but not all, of breast-ovary cancer families show linkage to this susceptibility locus, designated BRCA1. We report here the results of a linkage analysis of 145 families with both breast and ovarian cancer. These families contain either a total of three or more cases of early-onset (before age 60 years) breast cancer or ovarian cancer. All families contained at least one case of ovarian cancer. Overall, an estimated 76% of the 145 families are linked to the BRCA1 locus. None of the 13 families with cases of male breast cancer appear to be linked, but it is estimated that 92% (95% confidence interval 76% -100%) of families with no male breast cancer and with two or more ovarian cancers are linked to BRCA1. These data suggest that the breast-ovarian cancer-family syndrome is genetically heterogeneous. However, the large majority of families with early-onset breast cancer and with two or more cases of ovarian cancer are likely to be due to BRCA1 mutations..

Detection of eight BRCA1 mutations in 10 breast/ovarian cancer families, including 1 family with male breast cancer.
Genetic epidemiological evidence suggests that mutations in BRCA1 may be responsible for approximately one half of early onset familial breast cancer and the majority of familial breast/ovarian cancer. The recent cloning of BRCA1 allows for the direct detection of mutations, but the feasibility of presymptomatic screening for cancer susceptibility is unknown. We analyzed genomic DNA from one affected individual from each of 24 families with at least three cases of ovarian or breast cancer, using SSCP assays. Variant SSCP bands were subcloned and sequenced. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify sequence changes and to screen DNA from control individuals. Six frameshift and two missense mutations were detected in 10 different families. A frameshift mutation was detected in a male proband affected with both breast and prostate cancer. A 40-bp deletion was detected in a patient who developed intra-abdominal carcinomatosis 1 year after prophylactic oophorectomy. Mutations were detected throughout the gene, and only one was detected in more than a single family. These results provide further evidence that inherited breast and ovarian cancer can occur as a consequence of a wide array of BRCA1 mutations. These results suggests that development of a screening test for BRCA1 mutations will be technically challenging. The finding of a mutation in a family with male breast cancer, not previously thought to be related to BRCA1, also illustrates the potential difficulties of genetic counseling for individuals known to carry mutations..

Founder mutations in the BRCA1 gene in Polish families with breast-ovarian cancer.
We have undertaken a hospital-based study, to identify possible BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations in the Polish population. The study group consisted of 66 Polish families with cancer who have at least three related females affected with breast or ovarian cancer and who had cancer diagnosed, in at least one of the three affected females, at age < 50 years. A total of 26 families had both breast and ovarian cancers, 4 families had ovarian cancers only, and 36 families had breast cancers only. Genomic DNA was prepared from the peripheral blood leukocytes of at least one affected woman from each family. The entire coding region of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was screened for the presence of germline mutations, by use of SSCP followed by direct sequencing of observed variants. Mutations were found in 35 (53%) of the 66 families studied. All but one of the mutations were detected within the BRCA1 gene. BRCA1 abnormalities were identified in all four families with ovarian cancer only, in 67% of 27 families with both breast and ovarian cancer, and in 34% of 35 families with breast cancer only. The single family with a BRCA2 mutation had the breast-ovarian cancer syndrome. Seven distinct mutations were identified; five of these occurred in two or more families. In total, recurrent mutations were found in 33 (94%) of the 35 families with detected mutations. Three BRCA1 abnormalities - 5382insC, C61G, and 4153delA - accounted for 51%, 20%, and 11% of the identified mutations, respectively..

BRCA1 mutations in primary breast and ovarian carcinomas.
Loss of heterozygosity data from familial tumors suggest that BRCA1, a gene that confers susceptibility to ovarian and early-onset breast cancer, encodes a tumor suppressor. The BRCA1 region is also subject to allelic loss in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers, an indication that BRCA1 mutations may occur somatically in these tumors. The BRCA1 coding region was examined for mutations in primary breast and ovarian tumors that show allele loss at the BRCA1 locus. Mutations were detected in 3 of 32 breast and 1 of 12 ovarian carcinomas; all four mutations were germline alterations and occurred in early-onset cancers. These results suggest that mutation of BRCA1 may not be critical in the development of the majority of breast and ovarian cancers that arise in the absence of a mutant germline allele..

Penetrances of BRCA1 1675delA and 1135insA with respect to breast cancer and ovarian cancer.
For genetic counseling and predictive testing in families with inherited breast-ovarian cancer, penetrances and expressions of the underlying mutations should be known. We have previously reported two BRCA1 founder mutations in the Norwegian population. Index cases for the present study were found two different ways  through a series of consecutive ovarian cancers (n = 16) and through our family cancer clinic (n = 14). Altogether, 20 of the patients had BRCA1 1675delA, and 10 had 1135insA. Their relatives were described with respect to absence/presence of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Of 133 living female relatives, 83 (62%) were tested for the presence of a mutation. No difference, in penetrance and expression, between the two mutations were found, whereas differences according to method of ascertainment were seen. The overall findings were that disease started to occur at age 30 years and that by age 50 years 48% of the mutation-carrying women had experienced breast and/or ovarian cancer. More ovarian cancers than breast cancers were recorded. Both penetrance and expression (breast cancer vs. ovarian cancer) were different from those in reports of the Ashkenazi founder mutations. Whether the reported differences reflect true differences and/or methodological problems is discussed. An observed excess of mutation carriers could not be accounted for by methodological problems; possible explanations were a " true " low penetrance or preferential segregation..

Genetic analysis of the BRCA1 region in a large breast/ovarian family: refinement of the minimal region containing BRCA1.
We have analyzed a single multi-affected breast/ovarian cancer pedigree (BOV3) and have shown consistent inheritance of markers on chromosome 17q with the disease confirming that this family is due to the BRCA1 gene. Analysis of 17q haplotypes shows a recombination event in a bilateral breast cancer case which suggests that the BRCA1 gene lies distal to D17S857; D17S857 is thus the new proximal boundary for the region containing BRCA1. Combining this information with previously published mapping information suggests that BRCA1 is contained in a region estimated at 1-1. 5 Mb in length. All seven breast tumour/blood pairs examined from this family show loss of heterozygosity in the tumours. The allel retained in each tumour was from the disease-bearing chromosome implicating BRCA1 as a tumour suppressor gene. We have sequenced the 17 beta-oestradiol dehydrogenase genes (EDH17B1 and EDH17B2) which have been suggested as candidate genes for BRCA1 in four members of this family. No germline mutations were detected.

BRCA1 is associated with a human SWI/SNF-related complex: linking chromatin remodeling to breast cancer.
Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, BRCA1, predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancers. Using a combination of affinity- and conventional chromatographic techniques, we have isolated a predominant form of a multiprotein BRCA1-containing complex from human cells displaying chromatin-remodeling activity. Mass spectrometric sequencing of components of this complex indicated that BRCA1 is associated with a SWI/SNF-related complex. We show that BRCA1 can directly interact with the BRG1 subunit of the SWI/SNF complex. Moreover, p53-mediated stimulation of transcription by BRCA1 was completely abrogated by either a dominant-negative mutant of BRG1 or the cancer-causing deletion in exon 11 of BRCA1. These findings reveal a direct function for BRCA1 in transcriptional control through modulation of chromatin structure..

Confirmation of BRCA1 by analysis of germline mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancer in ten families.
We provide genetic evidence supporting the identity of the candidate gene for BRCA1 through the characterization of germline mutations in 63 breast cancer patients and 10 ovarian cancer patients in ten families with cancer linked to chromosome 17q21. Nine different mutations were detected by screening BRCA1 DNA and RNA by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Seven mutations lead to protein truncations at sites throughout the gene. One missense mutation (which occurred independently in two families) leads to loss of a cysteine in the zinc binding domain. An intronic single basepair substitution destroys an acceptor site and activates a cryptic splice site, leading to a 59 basepair insertion and chain termination. The four families with both breast and ovarian cancer had chain termination mutations in the N-terminal half of the protein..

A strong candidate for the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1.
A strong candidate for the 17q-linked BRCA1 gene, which influences susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer, has been identified by positional cloning methods. Probable predisposing mutations have been detected in five of eight kindreds presumed to segregate BRCA1 susceptibility alleles. The mutations include an 11-base pair deletion, a 1-base pair insertion, a stop codon, a missense substitution, and an inferred regulatory mutation. The BRCA1 gene is expressed in numerous tissues, including breast and ovary, and encodes a predicted protein of 1863 amino acids. This protein contains a zinc finger domain in its amino-terminal region, but is otherwise unrelated to previously described proteins. Identification of BRCA1 should facilitate early diagnosis of breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility in some individuals as well as a better understanding of breast cancer biology..

Genetic mapping of the breast-ovarian cancer syndrome to a small interval on chromosome 17q12-21: exclusion of candidate genes EDH17B2 and RARA.
A susceptibility gene for hereditary breast-ovarian cancer, BRCA1, has been assigned by linkage analysis to chromosome 17q21. Candidate genes in this region include EDH17B2, which encodes estradiol 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase II (17 beta-HSD II), and RARA, the gene for retinoic acid receptor alpha. We have typed 22 breast and breast-ovarian cancer families with eight polymorphisms from the chromosome 17q12-21 region, including two in the EDH17B2 gene. Genetic recombination with the breast cancer trait excludes RARA from further consideration as a candidate gene for BRCA1. Both BRCA1 and EDH17B2 map to a 6 cM interval (between THRA1 and D17S579) and no recombination was observed between the two genes. However, direct sequencing of overlapping PCR products containing the entire EDH17B2 gene in four unrelated affected women did not uncover any sequence variation, other than previously described polymorphisms. Mutations in the EDH17B2 gene, therefore do not appear to be responsible for the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome. Single meiotic crossovers in affected women suggest that BRCA1 is flanked by the loci RARA and D17S78..
