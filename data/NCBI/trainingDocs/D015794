Aberrant splicing of the CHM gene is a significant cause of choroideremia.
Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked progressive degeneration of the choroid and retina. 12% of unrelated male patients carry deletions of the partially cloned CHM gene. In Finland, there are more than 120 living CHM patients belonging to eight apparently unrelated pedigrees. Molecular deletions involving the CHM gene have been detected in three families. We have screened the remaining five families for point mutations. In one large family a single nucleotide (T) insertion into the donor splice site of exon C leads to two aberrantly spliced mRNAs both producing a premature stop codon. The mutation can be assayed easily by amplification and digestion with Msel. Our findings provide additional evidence for the pathogenetic role of CHM mutations and provide a diagnostic tool for one fifth of the worlds known CHM patients..

Haplotype and multipoint linkage analysis in Finnish choroideremia families.
Multipoint linkage analysis of choroideremia (TCD) and seven X chromosomal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) was carried out in 18 Finnish TCD families. The data place TCD distal to PGK and DXS72, very close to DXYS1 and DXYS5 (Zmax = 24 at theta = 0) and proximal to DXYS4 and DXYS12. This agrees with the data obtained from other linkage studies and from physical mapping. All the TCD males and carrier females studied have the same DXYS1 allele in coupling with TCD. In Northeastern Finland, 66/69 chromosomes carrying TCD had the same haplotype at loci DXS72, DXYS1, DXYS4, and DXYS12. The same haplotype is seen in only 15/99 chromosomes not carrying TCD. Moreover, in 71/104 non-TCD chromosomes, the haplotype at six marker loci is different from those seen in any of the 76 TCD chromosomes. This supports the previously described hypothesis that the large Northern Finnish choroideremia pedigrees, comprising a total of over 80 living patients representing more than a fifth of all TCD patients described worldwide, carry the same mutation. These linkage and haplotype data provide improved opportunities for prenatal diagnosis based on RFLP studies..

Mutation spectrum in the CHM gene of Danish and Swedish choroideremia patients.
The recent isolation of the complete open reading frame of the choroideremia (CHM) gene and the characterization of the exon-intron boundaries has paved the way to mutation detection in patients with classical choroideremia. We have performed mutation screening in patients from 15 Danish and Swedish families by using Southern blot hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique. Causative mutations in the CHM gene were detected in at least 12 families, indicating that a substantial part of the mutations can be identified by this approach. In four of these families deletions of different sizes were found. Thus, in one patient, the deletion resulted in the absence of only one exon, while in another the deletion comprised the entire CHM gene. Mapping of the deletion endpoints in these four patients and in another 11 male patients with sizeable deletions enabled us to construct a very detailed map of intervals 2 and 3 of Xq21. In the remaining 11 Danish and Swedish families at least 8 causative mutations were found by PCR-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing. Interestingly, all CHM gene mutations detected thus far in choroideremia patients give rise to the introduction of a premature stop codon..

Identification of mutations in Danish choroideremia families.
We have searched for mutations in the choroideremia gene (CHM) in patients from 12 Danish families in which CHM is segregating. Employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, and direct DNA sequencing, different mutations have been identified in 6 patients. All the mutations will interfere with the correct translation of the mRNA predicting a truncated protein or no gene product at all..

Choroideremia: close linkage to DXYS1 and DXYS12 demonstrated by segregation analysis and historical-genealogical evidence.
Linkage studies using restriction fragment length polymorphisms were conducted in the X-linked disorder, choroideremia, designated TCD for Progressive Tapeto-Choroidal Dystrophy. Previously demonstrated close linkage with locus DXYS1 was confirmed (lod 11. 44 at 0 recombination distance). In addition, locus DXYS12 was found to be closely linked with TCD (lod 3. 31 at 0 recombination distance). The disease mainly occurs in three large kindreds in remote Northern Finland. While formal genealogical proof is lacking, all presently living (more than 80 affected males and 120 carrier females) probably originate from a common founder couple born in 1644 and 1646, twelve generations ago. All 36 patients and 48 carriers tested from the three kindreds had the same haplotype (TCD/DXYS1, 11kb/DXYS12, 1. 6kb). Given that at least 105 female meioses transmitting TCD have occurred since 1650 in these kindreds, extremely close linkage between TCD, DXYS1 and DXYS12 is suggested. The above haplotype is a very useful diagnostic tool in these TCD families. We suggest that our historical-genealogical approach to linkage analysis may be possible elsewhere in similar isolated populations

Regional localization of polymorphic DNA loci on the proximal long arm of the X chromosome using deletions associated with choroideremia.
In two unrelated families, males have been identified who suffer from choroideremia and at the same time have an interstitial deletion on the proximal long arm of the X chromosome. By high-resolution banding we have characterized the deletion chromosomes as del (X) (q21. 1-q21 1-q21. 33) and del (X) (q21. 2-q21 2-q21. 31) respectively. By Southern blot analysis we have mapped ten different polymorphic DNA loci relative to the position of the deletion and the choroideremia locus TCD. One probe, p31, was shown to cover one of the breakpoints of the smallest deletion. The following order of the loci was suggested by deletion mapping  cen-DXS106-DXS72-TCD- (DXYS1/DXYS23/DXYS5) - DXYS2- (DXYS12/DXS3) - (DXS17/DXS101) - Xqter.
