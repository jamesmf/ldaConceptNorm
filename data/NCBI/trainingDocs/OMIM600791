Functional differences of the PDS gene product are associated with phenotypic variation in patients with Pendred syndrome and non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB4).
The PDS gene encodes a transmembrane protein, known as pendrin, which functions as a transporter of iodide and chloride. Mutations in this gene are responsible for Pendred syndrome and autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss at the DFNB4 locus on chromosome 7q31. A screen of 20 individuals from the midwestern USA with non-syndromic hearing loss and dilated vestibular aqueducts identified three people (15%) with PDS mutations. To determine whether PDS mutations in individuals with Pendred syndrome differ functionally from PDS mutations in individuals with non-syndromic hearing loss, we compared three common Pendred syndrome allele variants (L236P, T416P and E384G), with three PDS mutations reported only in individuals with non-syndromic hearing loss (V480D, V653A and I490L/G497S). The mutations associated with Pendred syndrome have complete loss of pendrin-induced chloride and iodide transport, while alleles unique to people with DFNB4 are able to transport both iodide and chloride, albeit at a much lower level than wild-type pendrin. We hypothesize that this residual level of anion transport is sufficient to eliminate or postpone the onset of goiter in individuals with DFNB4. We propose a model for pendrin function in the thyroid in which pendrin transports iodide across the apical membrane of the thyrocyte into the colloid space..

Pendred syndrome: phenotypic variability in two families carrying the same PDS missense mutation.
Pendred syndrome comprises congenital sensorineural hearing loss, thyroid goiter, and positive perchlorate discharge test. Recently, this autosomal recessive disorder was shown to be caused by mutations in the PDS gene, which encodes an anion transporter called pendrin. Molecular analysis of the PDS gene was performed in two consanguineous large families from Southern Tunisia comprising a total of 23 individuals affected with profound congenital deafness; the same missense mutation, L445W, was identified in all affected individuals. A widened vestibular aqueduct was found in all patients who underwent computed tomography (CT) scan exploration of the inner ear. In contrast, goiter was present in only 11 affected individuals, who interestingly had a normal result of the perchlorate discharge test whenever performed. The present results question the sensitivity of the perchlorate test for the diagnosis of Pendred syndrome and support the use of a molecular analysis of the PDS gene in the assessment of individuals with severe to profound congenital hearing loss associated with inner ear morphological anomaly even in the absence of a thyroid goiter..

Non-syndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct is caused by PDS mutations.
Enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA), known as the most common form of inner ear abnormality, has recently been of particular genetic interest because this anomaly is inherited in a recessive manner. The locus for non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss with EVA has been mapped to the same chromosomal region, 7q31, as the Pendred syndrome locus. In the present study, seven mutations in the PDS gene (PDS), the gene responsible for Pendred syndrome, have been found in families of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss with EVA. One family is homozygous, three families are compound heterozygotes, and two families are heterozygous but with no other mutation detected. The present results provide evidence that mutations in PDS cause both syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss..
