Retinoschisin, the X-linked retinoschisis protein, is a secreted photoreceptor protein, and is expressed and released by Weri-Rb1 cells.
X-linked retinoschisis is characterized by microcystic-like changes of the macular region and schisis within the inner retinal layers, leading to visual deterioration in males. Many missense and protein-truncating mutations of the causative gene RS1 have now been identified and are thought to be inactivating. RS1 encodes a 224 amino acid protein, retinoschisin, which contains a discoidin domain but is of unknown function. We have generated a polyclonal antibody against a peptide from a unique region within retinoschisin, which detects a protein of approximately 28 kDa in retinal samples reduced with dithiothreitol, but multimers sized > 40 kDa under non-reducing conditions. A screen of human tissues with this antibody reveals retinoschisin to be retina specific and the antibody detects a protein of similar size in bovine and murine retinae. We investigated the expression pattern in the retina of both RS1 mRNA (using in situ hybridization with riboprobes) and retinoschisin (using immunohistochemistry). The antisense riboprobe detected RS1 mRNA only in the photoreceptor layer but the protein product of the gene was present both in the photoreceptors and within the inner portions of the retina. Furthermore, differentiated retinoblastoma cells (Weri-Rb1 cells) were found to express RS1 mRNA and to release retinoschisin. These results suggest that retinoschisin is released by photo-receptors and has functions within the inner retinal layers. Thus, X-linked retinoschisis is caused by abnormalities in a putative secreted photoreceptor protein and is the first example of a secreted photo-receptor protein associated with a retinal dystrophy..

Statistical analysis of the two stage mutation model in von Hippel-Lindau disease, and in sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma.
Analysis of the age incidence curves for unilateral and bilateral retinoblastoma led Knudson to propose that hereditary tumours may arise by a single event and sporadic tumours by a two stage mutation process. It has been suggested recently that sporadic renal cell carcinoma may arise from a two stage mutation process. We analysed the age incidence curves for symptomatic renal cell carcinoma (n = 26) and cerebellar haemangioblastoma (n = 68) in 109 patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, and compared them to 104 patients with sporadic renal cell carcinoma and 43 patients with sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma. The age incidence curves for renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma in VHL disease were compatible with a single mutation model, whereas the age incidence curves for sporadic renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma suggested a two stage mutation process. These data are compatible with the VHL gene functioning as a recessive tumour suppressor gene. Sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma and some renal cell carcinoma may arise from somatic mutations inactivating both alleles at the VHL locus..

Meiotic segregation analysis of RB1 alleles in retinoblastoma pedigrees by use of single-sperm typing.
In hereditary retinoblastoma, different epidemiological studies have indicated a preferential paternal transmission of mutant retinoblastoma alleles to offspring, suggesting the occurrence of a meiotic drive. To investigate this mechanism, we analyzed sperm samples from six individuals from five unrelated families affected with hereditary retinoblastoma. Single-sperm typing techniques were performed for each sample by study of two informative short tandem repeats located either in or close to the retinoblastoma gene (RB1). The segregation probability of mutant RB1 alleles in sperm samples was assessed by use of the SPERMSEG program, which includes experimental parameters, recombination fractions between the markers, and segregation parameters. A total of 2, 952 single sperm from the six donors were analyzed. We detected a significant segregation distortion in the data as a whole (P =. 0099) and a significant heterogeneity in the segregation rate across donors (. 0092). Further analysis shows that this result can be explained by segregation distortion in favor of the normal allele in one donor only and that it does not provide evidence of a significant segregation distortion in the other donors. The segregation distortion favoring the mutant RB1 allele does not seem to occur during spermatogenesis, and, thus, meiotic drive may result either from various mechanisms, including a fertilization advantage or a better mobility in sperm bearing a mutant RB1 gene, or from the existence of a defectively imprinted gene located on the human X chromosome.

Molecular detection of chromosomal translocations that disrupt the putative retinoblastoma susceptibility locus.
A candidate DNA sequence with many of the properties predicted for the retinoblastoma susceptibility (RB1) locus has been cloned (S. H. Friend, R. Bernards, S. Rogelj, R. A. Weinberg, J. M. Rapaport, D. M. Albert, and T. P. Dryja, Nature [London] 323  643-645, 1986). The large size of this gene (ca. 200 kilobases [kb]) and its multiple dispersed exons (Wiggs et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 318  151-157, 1988) complicate molecular screening strategies important in prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis and in carrier detection. Here we used field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) to construct a restriction map of approximately 1, 000 kb of DNA surrounding the RB1 locus and to detect the translocation breakpoints in three retinoblastoma patients. DNA probes from either the 5 or 3 end of the gene were used to detect a 250-kb EagI restriction fragment in DNA from unaffected individuals. Both probes identified an additional hybridizing fragment in the DNA from each patient, permitting the breakpoints in all three to be mapped within the cloned RB1 gene. Analysis of the breakpoint in one translocation cell line allowed the RB1 gene to be oriented with its 5 end toward the centromere. The 5 end of the gene also appeared to be associated with a clustering of sites for several infrequently cleaving restriction enzymes, indicating the presence of an HpaII tiny fragment island. The detection and mapping of the translocation breakpoints of all three retinoblastoma patients to within the putative RB1 gene substantiated the authenticity of this candidate sequence and demonstrated the utility of FIGE in detecting chromosomal rearrangements affecting this locus.

Oncogenic point mutations in exon 20 of the RB1 gene in families showing incomplete penetrance and mild expression of the retinoblastoma phenotype.
The retinoblastoma-predisposition gene, RB1, segregates as an autosomal dominant trait with high (90%) penetrance. Certain families, however, show an unusual low-penetrance phenotype with many individuals being unaffected, unilaterally affected, or with evidence of spontaneously regressed tumors. We have used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and PCR sequencing to study two such families. Mutations were found in exon 20 of RB1 in both cases. In one family a C----T transition in codon 661 converts an arginine (CGG) to a tryptophan (TGG) codon. In this family, incomplete penetrance and mild phenotypic expression were observed in virtually all patients, possibly indicating that single amino acid changes may modify protein structure/function such that tumorigenesis is not inevitable. In the second family the mutation in codon 675 is a G----T transversion that converts a glutamine (GAA) to a stop (TAA) codon. However, this mutation also occurs near a potential cryptic splice acceptor site, raising the possibility of alternative splicing resulting in a less severely disrupted protein..

Molecular mechanisms of oncogenic mutations in tumors from patients with bilateral and unilateral retinoblastoma.
The RB1 gene from 12 human retinoblastoma tumors has been analyzed exon-by-exon with the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. Mutations were found in all tumors, and one-third of the tumors had independent mutations in both alleles neither of which were found in the germ line, confirming their true sporadic nature. In the remaining two-thirds of the tumors only one mutation was found, consistent with the loss-of-heterozygosity theory of tumorigenesis. Point mutations, the majority of which were C-- > T transitions, were the most common abnormality and usually resulted in the conversion of an arginine codon to a stop codon. Small deletions were the second most common abnormality and most often created a downstream stop codon as the result of a reading frameshift. Deletions and point mutations also affected splice junctions. Direct repeats were present at the breakpoint junctions in the majority of deletions, supporting a slipped-mispairing mechanism. Point mutations generally produced DNA sequences which resulted in perfect homology with endogenous sequences which lay within 14 bp..

Mutations in the RB1 gene and their effects on transcription.
Inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 gene during normal retinal development initiates the formation of a retinoblastoma (RB) tumor. To identify the mutations which inactivate RB1, 21 RB tumors isolated from 19 patients were analyzed with the polymerase chain reaction or an RNase protection assay or both. Mutations were identified in 13 of 21 RB tumors; in 8 tumors, the precise errors in nucleotide sequence were characterized. Each of four germ line mutations involved a small deletion or duplication, while three somatic mutations were point mutations leading to splice alterations and loss of an exon from the mature RB1 mRNA. We were unable to detect expression of the mutant allele in lymphoblasts of three bilaterally affected patients, although the mutation was present in the genomic DNA and transcripts containing the mutations were obvious in the RB tumors in the absence of a normal RB1 allele. The variations in the level of expression of mutant transcripts suggest deregulation of RB1 transcription in the absence of a functional RB1 gene product..

Deletions of a DNA sequence in retinoblastomas and mesenchymal tumors: organization of the sequence and its encoded protein.
Retinoblastoma is a childhood tumor that can arise because of mutant alleles acquired as somatic or germinal mutations. The mutant allele can be carried in the germ line. The mutations creating these alleles act by inactivating copies of a recessive oncogene located within band q14 of chromosome 13 and termed the RB1 locus. We have reported isolation of a cDNA fragment that recognizes chromosomal sequences possessing many of the attributes of the retinoblastoma gene associated with the RB1 locus. We now report that this segment is additionally the target of somatic mutations in mesenchymal tumors among patients having no apparent predisposition to retinoblastoma and no previous evidence of retinoblastoma. These tumors provide additional evidence that the cloned sequences are representative of a gene that is a frequent target of inactivation during tumorigenesis. Sequence analysis of this cDNA provides little insight into its normal functional role..

Re-evaluation of the sublocalization of esterase D and its relation to the retinoblastoma locus by in situ hybridization.
In situ hybridization of a cDNA probe for the esterase D gene (ESD) was carried out on human chromosomes. The probe hybridized most strongly to 13q14. 2 and 13q14. 3. This observation raises doubts concerning the most recently published assignment of ESD to 13q14. 1. A deletion in an individual with retinoblastoma was reported to separate the closely linked ESD and retinoblastoma (RB1) loci, placing ESD proximal to RB1. Quantitative in situ hybridization studies of this deletion do not confirm this interpretation. Rather, they suggest that ESD is missing from the deleted chromosome 13 and duplicated on the normal homolog. From these findings, we conclude that the deletion in this individual cannot be used to determine the orientation nor the sublocalization of ESD and RB1 within the 13q14 region.

Preferential germline mutation of the paternal allele in retinoblastoma.
The event triggering malignant proliferation in 70% of retinoblastoma tumours is loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 13q14, whereby the normal retinoblastoma gene (RB1) allele is lost and an already mutated RB1 allele remains in the tumour. The first allele suffers a mutational event--deletion, duplication or point mutation (manuscript in preparation) --either in the germ line (all bilateral patients) or in a somatic retinal cell (most unilateral patients). Most bilateral patients have no family history of retinoblastoma and are presumed to have new germline mutations which arose in the egg, sperm or early embryo. We have determined the parental origin of the retained allele in nine retinoblastoma tumours from eight unrelated non-familial cases by using RB1-linked genetic markers. Six tumours retained the paternal allele and three retained the maternal allele. Of the three unilateral tumours, only one retained the paternal RB1 allele. Thus, there is no evidence that the paternal RB1 allele is preferentially retained in retinoblastoma, as has been suggested to be the case in osteosarcoma. By contrast, tumours from four of the five bilateral patients retained the paternal RB1 allele. This suggests either that new germline RB1 mutations arise more frequently during spermatogenesis than during oogenesis, or that imprinting in the early embryo affects chromosomal susceptibility to mutation..

Spectrum of germline mutations in the RB1 gene: a study of 232 patients with hereditary and non hereditary retinoblastoma.
Germline mutations in the RB1 gene confer hereditary predisposition to retinoblastoma. We have performed a mutation survey of the RB1 gene in 232 patients with hereditary or non hereditary retinoblastoma. We systematically explored all 27 exons and flanking sequences as well as the promotor. All types of point mutations are represented and are found unequally distributed along the RB1 gene sequence. In the population we studied, exons 3, 8, 18 and 19 are preferentially altered. The range of frequency of detection of germline mutations is about 20%, indicating that other mechanisms of inactivation of RB1 should be involved. The spectrum of mutations presented here should help to improve the clinical management of retinoblastoma and to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to tumorigenesis..
