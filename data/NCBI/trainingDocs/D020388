Aminoglycoside antibiotics restore dystrophin function to skeletal muscles of mdx mice.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to the absence of the dystrophin protein in striated muscle. A significant number of these mutations are premature stop codons. On the basis of the observation that aminoglycoside treatment can suppress stop codons in cultured cells, we tested the effect of gentamicin on cultured muscle cells from the mdx mouse - an animal model for DMD that possesses a premature stop codon in the dystrophin gene. Exposure of mdx myotubes to gentamicin led to the expression and localization of dystrophin to the cell membrane. We then evaluated the effects of differing dosages of gentamicin on expression and functional protection of the muscles of mdx mice. We identified a treatment regimen that resulted in the presence of dystrophin in the cell membrane in all striated muscles examined and that provided functional protection against muscular injury. To our knowledge, our results are the first to demonstrate that aminoglycosides can suppress stop codons not only in vitro but also in vivo. Furthermore, these results raise the possibility of a novel treatment regimen for muscular dystrophy and other diseases caused by premature stop codon mutations. This treatment could prove effective in up to 15% of patients with DMD..

Nebulin seen in DMD males including one patient with a large DNA deletion encompassing the DMD gene.
The presence of nebulin in a muscle specimen from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) due to a large deletion precludes the possibility that this protein is the DMD gene product..

Nebulin and titin expression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy appears normal.
Monoclonal antibodies which recognize different epitopes on either titin or nebulin show normal staining patterns on frozen sections of three muscle biopsies of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting performed on two of these muscle biopsies show the normal pattern of titin and nebulin polypeptides. Since the donor of one of these biopsies has a large deletion of the 5-region of the DMD gene, our results argue against the recent proposal that nebulin is the gene mutated in DMD..

Mild and severe muscular dystrophy associated with deletions in Xp21 of the human X chromosome.
We have analysed over 300 patients suffering from Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD or BMD). Deletions have been characterised which encompass either the pERT87 (DXS164) locus only, the XJ1. 1 (DXS206) and HIP25 loci only, or all three loci. These loci have been shown to lie within the DMD region covering several hundred kilobases (kb) of DNA. One mildly affected BMD patient possesses a deletion of at least 110 kb including exons of the DMD gene. Other patients with similar exon deletions, or smaller deletions, show the more severe phenotype typical of DMD. We conclude from these studies that the severity of the clinical phenotype cannot be explained on the basis of the size of the deletion. We discuss this in the context of candidate gene sequences.

The effects of dystrophin gene mutations on the ERG in mice and humans.
PURPOSE. The authors earlier findings of a negative electroretinogram (ERG) in a boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) led them to investigate dystrophin gene deletions and ERGs in five boys with DMD. The authors wanted to determined whether there were similar ERG findings in an animal model for DMD, the mdx mouse. METHODS. Ganzfeld ERGs were recorded in five boys with DMD after a complete ophthalmic examination. The dystrophin gene was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. ERGs were recorded in anesthetized mdx and control mice with a modified Grass photostimulator (Grass Instrument Company, Quincy, MA). RESULTS. Ophthalmic examinations in all five boys had normal findings, yet an abnormal negative ERG was recorded for each subject. The subjects gene deletions were variable, ranging from large deletions to no detectable deletions. The ERGs of the mdx mice were normal and did not differ significantly from those of the control mice. CONCLUSIONS. The authors believe the unique ERG recorded for the human subjects is a manifestation of DMD associated with defects at the dystrophin gene locus and represents a new clinical entity. The ERG of the mdx mouse may be spared for several reasons, including milder effects of the mouse gene defect, differences in muscle and retinal gene product, or species differences in the biochemical role of dystrophin. The ERG shows promise of becoming a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DMD and its milder allelic forms..

Clinical use of DNA markers linked to the gene for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Seventy families with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) known to the Institute of Child Health fall into three categories with respect to potential linkage analysis with the X chromosome DNA markers RC8 and L1. 28 that bridge the DMD gene. Families in which there is at least one obligatory female heterozygote (n = 13). Here prediction and exclusion of DMD gene transmission may be possible, the accuracy being dependent on the closeness of the linkage of the DNA marker (s) to the DMD gene; an illustrative case is reported. Families in which there is a single affected boy, who also has one or more healthy brothers (n = 26). Given an informative restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), the probability that the boy represents a new mutation can be reassessed; it is also possible to exclude the DMD gene in a sister. Families with a single affected boy with no brother (n = 30). Here exclusion of the DMD gene in a sister may be possible. Only in one family was there no possibility of useful linkage analysis. The linkage analysis required is described, and the need to check DMD families for informative RFLPs is stressed.

Skewed X inactivation in a female MZ twin results in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
One of female MZ twins presented with muscular dystrophy. Physical examination, creatine phosphokinase levels, and muscle biopsy were consistent with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, because of her sex she was diagnosed as having limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. With cDNA probes to the DMD gene, a gene deletion was detected in the twins and their mother. The de novo mutation which arose in the mother was shown by novel junction fragments generated by HindIII, PstI, or TaqI when probed with cDNA8. Additional evidence of a large gene deletion was given by novel SfiI junction fragments detected by probes p20, J-Bir, and J-66 on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Immunoblot analysis of muscle from the affected twin showed dystrophin of normal size but of reduced amount. Immunofluorescent visualization of dystrophin revealed foci of dystrophin-positive fibers adjacent to foci of dystrophin-negative fibers. These data indicate that the affected twin is a manifesting carrier of an abnormal DMD gene, her myopathy being a direct result of underexpression of dystrophin. Cytogenetic analysis revealed normal karyotypes, eliminating the possibility of a translocation affecting DMD gene function. Both linkage analysis and DNA fingerprint analysis revealed that each twin has two different X chromosomes, eliminating the possibility of uniparental disomy as a mechanism for DMD expression. On the basis of methylation differences of the paternal and maternal X chromosomes in these MZ twins, we propose uneven lyonization (X chromosome inactivation) as the underlying mechanism for disease expression in the affected female..

Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy: correlation of phenotype by electroretinography with sites of dystrophin mutations.
The dark-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) of patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) shows a marked reduction in b-wave amplitude. Genotype-phenotype studies of mouse models for DMD show position-specific effects of the mutations upon the phenotype  mice with 5 defects of dystrophin have normal ERGs, those with defects in the central region have a normal b-wave amplitude associated with prolonged implicit times for both the b-wave and oscillatory potentials, and mice with 3 defects have a phenotype similar to that seen in  DMD/BMD patients. The mouse studies suggest a key role for the carboxyl terminal dystrophin isoform, Dp260, in retinal electrophysiology. We have undertaken a systematic evaluation of DMD/BMD patients through clinical examination and review of the literature in order to determine whether the position-specific effects of mutations noted in the mouse are present in man. We have found that, in man, a wider variation of DMD defects correlate with reductions in the b-wave amplitude. Individuals with normal ERGs have mutations predominantly located 5 of the transcript initiation site of Dp260. Our results suggest that the most important determinant in the ERG b-wave phenotype is the mutation position, rather than muscle disease severity. Forty-six per cent of patients with mutations 5 of the Dp260 transcript start site have abnormal ERGs, as opposed to 94% with more distal mutations. The human genotype-phenotype correlations are consistent with a role for Dp260 in normal retinal electrophysiology and may also reflect the expression of other C-terminal dystrophin isoforms and their contributions to retinal signal transmission..

Localization of the region homologous to the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus on the mouse X chromosome.
Recent progress has resulted in part of the gene mutated in Duchenne and the milder Becker muscular dystrophies being cloned and has suggested that the gene itself extends over 1, 000 to 2, 000 kilobases (kb). To study how mutations in this gene affect muscle development and integrity, it would be of interest to have available a mouse model of the human disease. The mouse mdx mutation affects muscle and confers a mild dystrophic syndrome, but it is not clear whether this mutation is equivalent to Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy in man. Here we describe the use of two sequences from the human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene that cross-hybridize to mouse X-linked sequences to localize the gene homologous to DMD in the mouse. Both sequences map to the region of 10 centimorgan lying between the Tabby (Ta) and St14-1 (DxPas8) loci, close to the phosphorylase b kinase locus (Phk). By analogy with the human X-chromosome, we conclude that the region in the mouse around the G6pd and St14-1 loci may contain two genes corresponding to distinct human myopathies  Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy which is known to be closely linked to St14-1 in man and the DMD homologue described here..

A normal male with an inherited deletion of one exon within the DMD gene.
We describe two brothers with identical inherited deletions of one single exon within the middle of the DMD gene; one brother has Becker muscular dystrophy diagnosed at 11 years of age, whereas the older brother is normal at 18. These results have implications for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis in families with Becker muscular dystrophy..

Detection of a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene by multiple SSCP.
A combination of multiplex PCR with the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique was employed to screen for point mutations in the human dystrophin gene. Co-amplification of 11 exons from genomic DNA of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) patients with no deletion or duplication was performed and the samples subjected to multiple SSCP analysis. We report the case of a nonsense mutation in a Duchenne patient identified by this approach. The mutation introduces a termination codon within exon 8 of the dystrophin gene. It is predicted to cause a very premature translational termination accounting for the severe phenotype observed. The patient inherited this mutation from his mother. In addition the analysis revealed 5 polymorphisms useful for internal control..

Duplicational mutation at the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus: its frequency, distribution, origin, and phenotypegenotype correlation.
Partial gene deletion is the major cause of mutation leading to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Partial gene duplication has also been recognized in a few cases. We have conducted a survey for duplication in 72 unrelated nondeletion patients, analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with clones representing the entire DMD cDNA. With careful quantitative analysis of hybridization band intensity, 10 cases were found to carry a duplication of part of the gene, a frequency of 14% for nondeletion cases (10/72), or 6% for all cases (10/181). The extent of these duplications has been characterized according to the published exon-containing HindIII fragment map, and in six of the 10 duplications a novel restriction fragment that spanned the duplication junction was detected. The resulting translational reading frame of mRNA has been predicted for nine duplications. A shift of the reading frame was predicted in four of the six DMD cases and in one of the two intermediate cases, while the reading frame remained uninterrupted in both BMD cases. RFLP and quantitative Southern blot analyses revealed a grandpaternal origin of duplication in four families and grandmaternal origin in one family. In all five families, the duplication was found to originate from a single X chromosome. Unequal sister-chromatid exchange is proposed to be the mechanism for the formation of these duplications..

The mapping of a cDNA from the human X-linked Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene to the mouse X chromosome.
The recent discovery of sequences at the site of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene in humans has opened up the possibility of a detailed molecular analysis of the genes in humans and in related mammalian species. Until relatively recently, there was no obvious mouse model of this genetic disease for the development of therapeutic strategies. The identification of a mouse X-linked mutant showing muscular dystrophy, mdx, has provided a candidate mouse genetic homologue to the DMD locus; the relatively mild pathological features of mdx suggest it may have more in common with mutations of the Becker muscular dystrophy type at the same human locus, however. But the close genetic linkage of mdx to G6PD and Hprt on the mouse X chromosome, coupled with its comparatively mild pathology, have suggested that the mdx mutation may instead correspond to Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy which itself is closely linked to DNA markers at Xq28-qter in the region of G6PD on the human X chromosome. Using an interspecific mouse domesticus/spretus cross, segregating for a variety of markers on the mouse X chromosome, we have positioned on the mouse X chromosome sequences homologous to a DMD cDNA clone. These sequences map provocatively close to the mdx mutation and unexpectedly distant from sparse fur, spf, the mouse homologue of OTC (ornithine transcarbamylase) which is closely linked to DMD on the human X chromosome..

Common sequence motifs at the rearrangement sites of a constitutional X/autosome translocation and associated deletion.
Reciprocal chromosome translocations are common de novo rearrangements that occur randomly throughout the human genome. To learn about causative mechanisms, we have cloned and sequenced the breakpoints of a cytologically balanced constitutional reciprocal translocation, t (X; 4) (p21. 2; q31. 22), present in a girl with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Physical mapping of the derivative chromosomes, after their separation in somatic cell hybrids, reveals that the translocation disrupts the DMD gene in Xp21 within the 18-kb intron 16. Restriction mapping and sequencing of clones that span both translocation breakpoints as well as the corresponding normal regions indicate the loss of approximately 5 kb in the formation of the derivative X chromosome, with 4-6 bp deleted from chromosome 4. RFLP and Southern analyses indicate that the de novo translocation is a paternal origin and that the fathers X chromosome contains the DNA that is deleted in the derivative X. Most likely, deletion and translation arose simultaneously from a complex rearrangement event that involves three chromosomal breakpoints. Short regions of sequence homology were present at the three sites. A 5-bp sequence, GGAAT, found exactly at the translocation breakpoints on both normal chromosomes X and 4, has been preserved only on the der (4) chromosome. It is likely that the X-derived sequence GGAATCA has been lost in the formation of the der (X) chromosome, as it matches an inverted GAATCA sequence present on the opposite strand exactly at the other end of the deleted 5-kb fragment.

Molecular and phenotypic analysis of patients with deletions within the deletion-rich region of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene.
Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the DMD locus. This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7, all exons detected by cDNA8, and the first two exons detected by cDNA9. These 80 individuals account for approximately 75% of 109 deletions of the gene, detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA. Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; present paper). Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Of these, eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame. Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions. This is in agreement with recent findings by Baumbach et al. and Koenig et al. but is in contrast to findings, by Malhotra et al. at the 5 ' end of the gene.

Patterns of exon deletions in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy.
A panel of patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD) has been screened with the cDNA probes Cf56a and Cf23a, which detect exons in the central part of the DMD gene. One or more exons were deleted in 60% of patients. The deletions were mapped and prove to be heterogeneous in size and extent, particularly in DMD. Deletions specific to DMD and to BMD are described. Half of all BMD patients have a deletion of one particular small group of exons; smaller deletions within this same group produce the more severe DMD..

Treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy with growth hormone inhibitors.
A controlled, double-blind therapeutic trial with the drug mazindol, a growth hormone inhibitor, was performed in a pair of 7 1/2 year-old monozygotic twins, with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The rationale for this trial was based on a patient (reported previously) affected simultaneously with DMD and growth hormone (GH) deficiency, who is showing a benign course of the dystrophic process and is still walking at 18 years. One of the twins received 2 mg of mazindol daily, while the other received a placebo. The assessment, repeated every 2 months, included weight and height measurements, functional and motor ability tests, ergometry and determinations of serum enzymes and GH levels. After one year of trial the code was broken and it was seen that the twin under placebo treatment was strikingly worse than his brother, the progression of whose condition was practically arrested. These results strongly suggest that treatment with a GH inhibitor is beneficial for DMD patients..

Segregation analysis of a marker localised Xp21.2-Xp21.3 in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy families.
A DNA marker C7, localised Xp21. 1-Xp21. 3, has been studied in kindreds segregating for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). In DMD families four crossovers were observed in 38 informative meioses between C7 and the DMD locus (theta = 0. 12, z max = + 2. 72). In BMD families no recombinants were observed in the 16 informative meioses studied. These data are consistent with the localisation of the mutations in these disorders being in the same region of Xp21. Studies in families also segregating for the DNA marker 754 support the previously reported physical order of these loci as X centromere-754-DMD-BMD-C7-X telomere. A recombination fraction of 0. 11 (z max = + 5. 58) was found between DMD-754 by combining our previously published data with the data presented here. C7 and 754 thus provide good bridging markers for the diagnosis of DMD and BMD

Estimation of the male to female ratio of mutation rates from the segregation of X-chromosomal DNA haplotypes in Duchenne muscular dystrophy families.
A novel procedure is presented to estimate the ratio of male to female mutation rates for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). X-specific restriction fragment length polymorphisms are used to establish DNA haplotypes in three-generation DMD families. From the proportion of DMD patients who have inherited their maternal grandfathers X chromosome, the ratio of mutation rates can be calculated. In contrast to classical methods, the proposed procedure is not restricted to sporadic or familiar cases nor is any information on the carrier status of female relatives required..

Germinal mosaicism in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy family: implications for genetic counselling.
In this study we describe a three-generation family in which two siblings were affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Immunohistochemical analysis of muscle dystrophin and haplotype analysis of the DMD locus revealed that the X chromosome carrying the DMD gene was transmitted from the healthy maternal grandfather to his three daughters, including the probands mother. These findings indicate that the grandfather was a germinal mosaic for the DMD gene. The definition of the carrier status in two possible carriers led us to give accurate genetic counselling and to prevent the birth of an affected boy. The results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of haplotype analysis and immunohistochemical muscle dystrophin studies to detect hidden germinal mosaicism and to improve genetic counselling..

A 71-kilodalton protein is a major product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in brain and other nonmuscle tissues.
The known Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene products, the muscle- and brain-type dystrophin isoforms, are 427-kDa proteins translated from 14-kilobase (kb) mRNAs. Recently we described a 6. 5-kb mRNA that also is transcribed from the DMD gene. Cloning and in vitro transcription and translation of the entire coding region show that the 6. 5-kb mRNA encodes a 70. 8-kDa protein that is a major product of the DMD gene. It contains the C-terminal and the cysteine-rich domains of dystrophin, seven additional amino acids at the N terminus, and some modifications formed by alternative splicing in the C-terminal domain. It lacks the entire large domain of spectrin-like repeats and the actin-binding N-terminal domain of dystrophin. This protein is the major DMD gene product in brain and other nonmuscle tissues but is undetectable in skeletal muscle extracts.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene expression in normal and diseased human muscle.
A probe for the 5 end of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene was used to study expression of the gene in normal human muscle, myogenic cell cultures, and muscle from patients with DMD. Expression was found in RNA from normal fetal muscle, adult cardiac and skeletal muscle, and cultured muscle after myoblast fusion. In DMD muscle, expression of this portion of the gene was also revealed by in situ RNA hybridization, particularly in regenerating muscle fibers..

Localisation of the Becker muscular dystrophy gene on the short arm of the X chromosome by linkage to cloned DNA sequences.
A linkage study in 30 Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) kindreds using three cloned DNA sequences from the X chromosome which demonstrate restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), suggests that the BMD gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome, in the p21 region. The genes for Becker and Duchenne dystrophies must therefore be closely linked, if not allelic, and any future DNA probes found to be of practical use in one disorder should be equally applicable to the other. The linkage analysis also provides data on the frequency of recombination along the short arm of the X chromosome, and across the centromeric region..

An error in dystrophin mRNA processing in golden retriever muscular dystrophy, an animal homologue of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a spontaneous, X-linked, progressively fatal disease of dogs and is also a homologue of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Two-thirds of DMD patients carry detectable deletions in their dystrophin gene. The defect underlying the remaining one-third of DMD patients is undetermined. Analysis of the canine dystrophin gene in normal and GRMD dogs has failed to demonstrate any detectable loss of exons. Here, we have demonstrated a RNA processing error in GRMD that results from a single base change in the 3 consensus splice site of intron 6. The seventh exon is then skipped, which predicts a termination of the dystrophin reading frame within its N-terminal domain in exon 8. This is the first example of dystrophin deficiency caused by a splice-site mutation..

Complex glycerol kinase deficiency: molecular-genetic, cytogenetic, and clinical studies of five Japanese patients.
Five male Japanese patients with complex glycerol kinase deficiency (CGKD) and their relatives were studied clinically, cytogenetically, and molecular-genetically. All patients had muscular dystrophy or muscle weakness, mental retardation, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, and glycerol kinase deficiency. High-resolution GTG-banded chromosomes showed a microdeletion in the Xp21 region in all four patients examined and in all five mothers. Southern hybridizations, after digestions by restriction endonucleases, with various cloned DNAs (D2, 99-6, B24, C7, L1-4, cDMD13-14, J66-HI, P20, J-Bir, ERT87-30, ERT87-15, ERT87-8, ERT87-1, XJ-1. 1, 754, cx5. 7, and OTC-1) that are located around Xp21 also showed a deletion in the genome of all patients and mothers. Although the deletion differed in size among patients, a segment commonly absent was located between the genomic sequences corresponding to L1-4 and cDMD13-14. This finding indicated that the gene coding for glycerol kinase (GK) is located within this segment. A comparison of the clinical manifestations of the present five patients and reported CGKD or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients with DNA deletion suggests the existence of a certain gene responsible for gonadotropin deficiency (GTD). The result of the present study and results of previous studies suggest that genes for ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), DMD, and GK and putative genes responsible for congenital adrenal hypoplasia (AHC) and GTD are arranged from telomere to centromere as pter--GTD--AHC--GK--DMD--OTC--cen

Duchenne muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy in the same patient.
We report on the first patient identified with myotonic dystrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The family of the propositus had a strong history of myotonic dystrophy, and there was an intrafamilial pathological expansion of the responsible CTG repeat between the mildly affected mother (160 repeats; normal 27 repeats) and her more severely affected son (650 repeats), and his sister (650 repeats). The propositus was an isolated case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy with marked dystrophin deficiency in muscle biopsy. The patient was still ambulatory post age 16. Myotonic dystrophy could interfere to some extent with the progression of Duchenne dystrophy. However, other interpretations are possible. Twelve percent of dystrophin revertant fibers as observed by immunohistochemistry could be sufficient to ameliorate typical DMD clinical severity, or the patient may present a somatic mosaic. The pathophysiological interactions of these two unlinked disorders are discussed at the clinical and histopathological levels..

Analysis of deletions in DNA from patients with Becker and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder for which the biochemical defect is as yet unknown. Recently, two cloned segments of human X-chromosome DNA have been described which detect structural alterations within or near the genetic locus responsible for the disorder. Both of these cloned segments were described as tightly linked to the locus and were capable of detecting deletions in the DNA of boys affected with DMD. In an attempt to determine more precisely the occurrence of these deletions within a large population of DMD patients and the accuracy of one of the segments, DXS164 (pERT87), in determining the inheritance of the DMD X chromosome, the subclones 1, 8 and 15 were made available to many investigators throughout the world. Here we describe the combined results of more than 20 research laboratories with respect to the occurrence of deletions at the DXS164 locus in DNA samples isolated from patients with DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). The results indicate that the DXS164 locus apparently recombines with DMD 5% of the time, but is probably located between independent sites of mutation which yield DMD. The breakpoints of some deletions are delineated within the DXS164 locus, and it is evident that the deletions at the DMD locus are frequent and extremely large..

Additional case of female monozygotic twins discordant for the clinical manifestations of Duchenne muscular dystrophy due to opposite X-chromosome inactivation.
A pair of female monozygotic (MZ) twins, heterozygous carriers for a deletion in the DMD gene and discordant for the clinical manifestations of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, were analyzed by molecular studies, in situ hybridization, and methylation pattern of X chromosomes to search for opposite X inactivation as an explanation of their clinical discordance. Results in lymphocytes and skin fibroblast cell lines suggest a partial mirror inactivation with the normal X chromosome preferentially active in the unaffected twin, and the maternal deleted X chromosome preferentially active in the affected twin. A review shows that MZ female twins discordant for X-linked diseases are not uncommon. Twinning and X inactivation may be interrelated and could explain the female twins discordant for X-linked traits..

Conservation of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in mice and humans.
A portion of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene transcript from human fetal skeletal muscle and mouse adult heart was sequenced, representing approximately 25 percent of the total, 14-kb DMD transcript. The nucleic acid and predicted amino acid sequences from the two species are nearly 90 percent homologous. The amino acid sequence that is predicted from this portion of the DMD gene indicates that the protein product might serve a structural role in muscle, but the abundance and tissue distribution of the messenger RNA suggests that the DMD protein is not nebulin..

Detection of 98% of DMD/BMD gene deletions by polymerase chain reaction.
We describe oligonucleotide primer sequences that can be used to amplify eight exons plus the muscle promoter of the dystrophin gene in a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). When used in conjunction with an existing primer set, these two multiplex reactions detect about 98% of deletions in patients with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD, BMD). Furthermore, these primers amplify most of the exons in the deletion prone " hot spot " region around exons 44 to 53, allowing determination of deletion endpoints and prediction of mutational effects on the translational reading frame. Thus, use of these PCR-based assays will allow deletion detection and prenatal diagnosis for most DMD/BMD patients in a fraction of the time required for Southern blot analysis..

Germinal mosaicism in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
We have identified a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) pedigree where the disease is associated with a molecular deletion within the DMD locus. We have examined the meiotic segregation products of the common female ancestor using marker restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) detected by probes that lie within this deletion. These studies show that this female has transmitted three distinct types of X chromosome to her offspring. This observation may be explained by postulating that the mutation arose as a postzygotic deletion within this common ancestor, who was consequently germinally mosaic..

Expression of the murine Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in muscle and brain.
Complementary DNA clones were isolated that represent the 5 terminal 2. 5 kilobases of the murine Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Dmd) messenger RNA (mRNA). Mouse Dmd mRNA was detectable in skeletal and cardiac muscle and at a level approximately 90 percent lower in brain. Dmd mRNA is also present, but at much lower than normal levels, in both the muscle and brain of three different strains of dystrophic mdx mice. The identification of Dmd mRNA in brain raises the possibility of a relation between human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene expression and the mental retardation found in some DMD males. These results also provide evidence that the mdx mutations are allelic variants of mouse Dmd gene mutations.
