Linkage analysis in a large Brazilian family with van der Woude syndrome suggests the existence of a susceptibility locus for cleft palate at 17p11.2-11.1.
van der Woude syndrome (VWS), which has been mapped to 1q32-41, is characterized by pits and/or sinuses of the lower lip, cleft lip/palate (CL/P), cleft palate (CP), bifid uvula, and hypodontia (H). The expression of VWS, which has incomplete penetrance, is highly variable. Both the occurrence of CL/P and CP within the same genealogy and a recurrence risk < 40% for CP among descendants with VWS have suggested that the development of clefts in this syndrome is influenced by modifying genes at other loci. To test this hypothesis, we have conducted linkage analysis in a large Brazilian kindred with VWS, considering as affected the individuals with CP, regardless of whether it is associated with other clinical signs of VWS. Our results suggest that a gene at 17p11. 2-11 2-11. 1, together with the VWS gene at 1p32-41, enhances the probability of CP in an individual carrying the two at-risk genes. If this hypothesis is confirmed in other VWS pedigrees, it will represent one of the first examples of a gene, mapped through linkage analysis, which modifies the expression of a major gene.

Confirmation of linkage of Van der Woude syndrome to chromosome 1q32: evidence of association with STR alleles suggests possible unique origin of the disease mutation.
Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal dominant craniofacial disorder with high penetrance and variable expression. Its clinical features are variably expressed, but include cleft lip and/or cleft palate, lip pits and hypodontia. All VWS families studied to date map the disease gene to a < 2 cM region of chromosome 1q32, with no evidence of locus heterogeneity. The aim of this study is to refine the localization of the VWS gene and to further assess possible heterogeneity. We analyzed four multiplex VWS families. All available members were clinically assessed and genotyped for 19 short tandem repeat markers on chromosome 1 in the VWS candidate gene region. We performed two-point and multipoint limit of detection (LOD) score analyses using a high penetrance autosomal dominant model. All families showed positive LOD scores without any recombination in the candidate region. The largest two-point LOD score was 5. 87 87. Our assay method for short tandem repeat (STR) markers provided highly accurate size estimation of marker allele fragment sizes, and therefore enabled us to determine the specific alleles segregating with the VWS gene in each of our four families. We observed a striking pattern of STR allele sharing at several closely linked loci among our four Caucasian VWS families recruited at three different locations in the US. These results suggest the possibility of a unique origin for a mutation responsible for many or most cases of VWS.

Genetic analysis in families with van der Woude syndrome.
We have brought together information on 864 affected individuals in 164 families (including three new pedigrees) reported in the 137 year period since 1845 when Demarquay first described a family with what was later called van der Woude syndrome (VWS). Both types of oral cleft, cleft palate (CP) and cleft lip with or without CP (CLP), segregate in these families together with lower lip pits or fistulae in an autosomal dominant mode with high penetrance estimated to be K =. 89 and. 99 by different methods. Cleft types (CLP and CP) occur in VWS in the same proportions as in the general non-VWS population, ie, about twice as many cleft-bearing individuals have CLP as have CP. On the other hand, we do not find the usually observed excess of females with CP and excess of males with CLP; in VWS the sex ratios are more nearly equal. Lip pits also are equally distributed between the sexes. Affected males and females are equally likely to transmit VWS. However, there is an excess of less severely affected individuals among transmitters and a deficiency of more severely affected, brought about by a proband bias and differential fecundity. The expression of VWS is significantly modified by the genetic background  More extreme phenotypes in parents tend to produce more extreme expression in their children. For a VWS gene carrier the relative risk of transmitting a cleft is 26. 45%; that of transmitting lower lip pits is 23. 55%. Three pedigrees of lip pits in the literature show no clefts among a significant number of affected individuals. Control of gene expression in VWS in the three target tissues appears to be independent and separately designated. Mutation rate of the VWS gene is calculated to be 1. 8 X 10 (-5)

Microdeletions at chromosome bands 1q32-q41 as a cause of Van der Woude syndrome.
Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal dominant disorder comprising cleft lip and/or cleft palate and lip pits. We reported previously a family whose underlying mutation is a 500-800 kb deletion localized to chromosome bands 1q32-q41 [Sander et al., 1994  Hum Mol Genet 3  576-578]. Along with cleft lip/palate and lip pits, affected relatives exhibit developmental delays, suggesting that the function of a gene nearby may also be disrupted. To further localize the VWS gene we searched for other deletions that cause VWS. An allele loss assay was performed using a novel highly polymorphic marker, D1S3753. From a panel of 37 unrelated individuals, we detected an allele loss in one family, indicating the presence of a deletion. In this family, the phenotype in three generations of affected individuals was confined to the cardinal signs of VWS. Surprisingly, mapping of the new deletion showed that it extended 0. 2-1 Mb beyond the proximal breakpoint for the deletion described previously. No deletions were detected in seven cases of popliteal pterygia syndrome, 76 cases of mixed syndromic forms of cleft lip and palate, and 178 cases of nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate.

Linkage analysis of 5 novel van der Woude syndrome kindreds to 1q32-q41 markers further supports locus homogeneity of the disease trait.
van der Woude syndrome (vWS, MIM 119300) is a rare autosomal dominant clefting condition with cardinal features of mucous cysts (lower-lip pits) and clefts to the lip and/or palate. The vWS gene has been assigned to a locus in 1q32-q41 by linkage analysis and physical mapping. We have investigated 5 novel vWS families through probands attended for cleft lip and/or palate repair at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery of Hopital Trousseau, Paris, in order to tentatively refine the genetic map of the vWS region in 1q32-q41 and possibly identify unlinked pedigrees. Linkage analysis was carried out to 6 microsatellite markers (D1S249, D1S425, D1S491, D1S205, D1S414, D1S425), yielding a maximum cumulative LOD score of Z = 3. 27 at theta = 0. 00 for D1S245. The innermost four markers were found to be tightly linked to one another, with no evidence for recombination. Our results support linkage of vWS within a region of tightly linked markers and do not favour locus heterogeneity of the disease trait.
