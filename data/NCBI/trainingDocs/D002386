Mice deficient in Six5 develop cataracts: implications for myotonic dystrophy.
Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3 UTR of the gene DMPK at the DM1 locus on chromosome 19 causes myotonic dystrophy, a dominantly inherited disease characterized by skeletal muscle dystrophy and myotonia, cataracts and cardiac conduction defects. Targeted deletion of Dm15, the mouse orthologue of human DMPK, produced mice with a mild myopathy and cardiac conduction abnormalities, but without other features of myotonic dystrophy, such as myotonia and cataracts. We, and others, have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of the adjacent gene SIX5 (refs 7, 8), which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor. To determine whether SIX5 deficiency contributes to the myotonic dystrophy phenotype, we disrupted mouse Six5 by replacing the first exon with a beta-galactosidase reporter. Six5-mutant mice showed reporter expression in multiple tissues, including the developing lens. Homozygous mutant mice had no apparent abnormalities of skeletal muscle function, but developed lenticular opacities at a higher rate than controls. Our results suggest that SIX5 deficiency contributes to the cataract phenotype in myotonic dystrophy, and that myotonic dystrophy represents a multigenic disorder..

Knobloch syndrome involving midline scalp defect of the frontal region.
We report on a 4-year-old boy with Knobloch syndrome. He has vitreoretinal degeneration, high myopia, cataract, telecanthus, hypertelorism, and a high-arched palate. He also has a defect of the anterior midline scalp with involvement of the frontal bone as documented by a computed tomography (CT) scan. The brain was normal on CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging. We present a review of the 23 published cases with this syndrome. Our patient illustrates the importance of investigating for underlying ocular and central nervous system pathology whenever midline scalp defects are present..

Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants: Gd (+) Alexandra associated with neonatal jaundice and Gd (-) Camperdown in a young man with lamellar cataracts.
Two male subjects are described, with unusual clinical presentations and with hitherto undescribed G6PD variants. The first, of Italian extraction, suffered from severe neonatal jaundice following maternal ingestion of fresh broad beans (Vicia fava) both prenatally and postnatally  the expression of the enzymatic defect was much more severe in the neonatal period than on retesting in adolescence, when biochemical characterization showed unique features which justify designation as a new variant Gd (+) Alexandra. The second patient, a boy of Maltese extraction who was found to have bilateral lamellar cataracts at the age of 4 years, was identified as G6PD deficient only as a result of a survey of children of Mediterranean origin with unexplained cataract formation; he has approximately 15% of normal enzyme activity, with another unique combination of biochemical characteristics which has led to its designation as Gd (-) Camperdown. Although this association may be coincidental, it prompts further attention to the possibility that under certain circumstances G6PD deficiency may favor cataract formation. The two cases illustrate the value of characterization of the mutant enzyme whenever unexpected clinical or laboratory results are obtained..

Heterozygous loss of Six5 in mice is sufficient to cause ocular cataracts.
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal muscle wasting, myotonia, cardiac arrhythmia, hyperinsulinaemia, mental retardation and ocular cataracts. The genetic defect in DM is a CTG repeat expansion located in the 3 untranslated region of DMPK and 5 of a homeodomain-encoding gene, SIX5 (formerly DMAHP; refs 2-5). There are three mechanisms by which CTG expansion can result in DM. First, repeat expansion may alter the processing or transport of the mutant DMPK mRNA and consequently reduce DMPK levels. Second, CTG expansion may establish a region of heterochromatin 3 of the repeat sequence and decrease SIX5 transcription. Third, toxic effects of the repeat expansion may be intrinsic to the repeated elements at the level of DNA or RNA (refs 10, 11). Previous studies have demonstrated that a dose-dependent loss of Dm15 (the mouse DMPK homologue) in mice produces a partial DM phenotype characterized by decreased development of skeletal muscle force and cardiac conduction disorders. To test the role of Six5 loss in DM, we have analysed a strain of mice in which Six5 was deleted. Our results demonstrate that the rate and severity of cataract formation is inversely related to Six5 dosage and is temporally progressive. Six5 +/- and Six5-/- mice show increased steady-state levels of the Na +/K + -ATPase alpha-1 subunit and decreased Dm15 mRNA levels. Thus, altered ion homeostasis within the lens may contribute to cataract formation. As ocular cataracts are a characteristic feature of DM, these results demonstrate that decreased SIX5 transcription is important in the aetiology of DM. Our data support the hypothesis that DM is a contiguous gene syndrome associated with the partial loss of both DMPK and SIX5..

PAX6 gene dosage effect in a family with congenital cataracts, aniridia, anophthalmia and central nervous system defects.
The human eye malformation aniridia results from haploinsufficiency of PAX6, a paired box DNA-binding protein. To study this dosage effect, we characterized two PAX6 mutations in a family segregating aniridia and a milder syndrome consisting of congenital cataracts and late onset corneal dystrophy. The nonsense mutations, at codons 103 and 353, truncate PAX6 within the N-terminal paired and C-terminal PST domains, respectively. The wild-type PST domain activates transcription autonomously and the mutant form has partial activity. A compound heterozygote had severe craniofacial and central nervous system defects and no eyes. The pattern of malformations is similar to that in homozygous Sey mice and suggests a critical role for PAX6 in controlling the migration and differentiation of specific neuronal progenitor cells in the brain..

Three novel aniridia mutations in the human PAX6 gene.
Aniridia (iris hypoplasia) is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder of the eye. Mutations in the human aniridia (PAX6) gene have now been identified in many patients from various ethnic groups. In the study reported here we describe PAX6 mutations in one sporadic and five familial cases with aniridia. Of the four different mutations identified, one was identical to a previously reported mutation (C-- > T transition at codon 240), and three were novel  two in the glycine-rich region and one in the proline/serine/threonine-rich (PST) region. One PAX6 mutation found in the PST region was associated with cataracts in an aniridia family. Another splice mutation in the PST domain occurred in an aniridia patient with anosmia (inability to smell). The six new aniridia cases reported here have mutations predicted to generate incomplete PAX6 proteins. These results support the theory that human aniridia is caused by haploinsufficiency of PAX6..

Genetics of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX): an autosomal recessive trait with high gene frequency in Sephardim of Moroccan origin.
We described 6 patients (from 3 families) affected with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). All are Sephardic Jews of Moroccan extraction. In view of the small number of CTX patients diagnosed in the world (a total of 50 including our 6 patients), we are probably dealing with an ethnic subgroup with a high CTX gene frequency, which we have estimated to be 1/108. Since there are differences in expression in this disease, we recommend cholestanol study in cases of undiagnosed cataract or tendinous xanthomas in childhood or early adolescence. The diagnosis in CTX is important not only for genetic counseling, but also in veiw of possible treatment..

Increased incidence of cataracts in male subjects deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in RBCs was found significantly more frequently in 210 male cataractous patients than in 672 control subjects of Sardinian origin. The frequency of the deficiency was increasingly higher in presenile cataracts. In the G6PD-deficient group, the incidence of cortical and total cataracts was also increased. It is suggested that decrease of the G6PD activity in the lens, which accompanies its deficiency in the erythrocyte, might play a role in the cataracto-genesis of these patients. Moreover, G6PD deficiency should be added to other conditions, such as the galactosemic states and riboflavin deficiency, where cataracts represent a sensitive indicator of metabolic abnormalities of the RBC..

Tightly linked flanking markers for the Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome, with application to carrier assessment.
The Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome (OCRL) is characterized by congenital cataract, mental retardation, and defective renal tubular function. A map assignment of OCRL to Xq24-q26 has been made previously by linkage analysis with DXS42 at Xq24-q26 (theta = 0, z = 5. 09) and with DXS10 at Xq26 (theta = 0, z = 6. 45). Two additional families were studied and three additional polymorphisms were identified at DXS42 by using a 35-kb sequence isolated with the probe detecting the original polymorphism at DXS42. With additional OCRL families made informative for DXS42, theta remained 0 with z = 6. 63; and for DXS10 theta = 0. 03 and z = 7. 07. Evidence for placing OCRL at Xq25 also comes from a female with Lowe syndrome and an X; 3 translocation. We have used the Xq25 breakpoint in this patient to determine the position of OCRL relative to the two linked markers. Each derivative chromosome was isolated away from its normal counterpart in somatic cell hybrids. DXS42 was mapped to the derivative chromosome X containing Xpterq25, and DXS10 was mapped to the derivative chromosome 3 containing Xq25-qter. The markers DXS10 and DXS42 therefore show tight linkage with OCRL in six families and flank the Xq25 breakpoint in a female patient with an X; 3 translocation. Linkage analysis with flanking markers was used to assess OCRL carrier status in women at risk. Results, when compared with carrier determination by ophthalmologic examination, indicated that the slit-lamp exam can be a sensitive and specific method of carrier determination in many cases

Missense mutation in the alternative splice region of the PAX6 gene in eye anomalies.
The PAX6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis, and PAX6 mutations have been detected in various types of ocular anomalies, including aniridia, Peters anomaly, corneal dystrophy, congenital cataract, and foveal hypoplasia. The gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its paired-type DNA-binding domain. The paired domain is composed of two distinct DNA-binding subdomains, the N-terminal subdomain (NTS) and the C-terminal subdomain (CTS), which bind respective consensus DNA sequences. The human PAX6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain. The insertion, into the NTS, of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the DNA-binding activity of the NTS and unmasks the DNA-binding ability of the CTS. Thus, exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes. We ascertained a novel missense mutation in four pedigrees with Peters anomaly, congenital cataract, Axenfeldt anomaly, and/or foveal hypoplasia, which, to our knowledge, is the first mutation identified in the splice-variant region. A T-- > A transition at the 20th nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a Val-- > Asp (GTC-- > GAC) substitution at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region. Functional analyses demonstrated that the V54D mutation slightly increased NTS binding and decreased CTS transactivation activity to almost half..
