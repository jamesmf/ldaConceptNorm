Cloning of breakpoints of a chromosome translocation identifies the AN2 locus.
Chromosome translocations involving 11p13 have been associated with familial aniridia in two kindreds highlighting the chromosomal localization of the AN2 locus. This locus is also part of the WAGR complex (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation). In one kindred, the translocation is associated with a deletion, and probes for this region were used to identify and clone the breakpoints of the translocation in the second kindred. Comparison of phage restriction maps exclude the presence of any sizable deletion in this case. Sequences at the chromosome 11 breakpoint are conserved in multiple species, suggesting that the translocation falls within the AN2 gene..

Submicroscopic deletions at the WAGR locus, revealed by nonradioactive in situ hybridization.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with biotin-labeled probes mapping to 11p13 has been used for the molecular analysis of deletions of the WAGR (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) locus. We have detected a submicroscopic 11p13 deletion in a child with inherited aniridia who subsequently presented with Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney, only revealed at surgery. The mother, who has aniridia, was also found to carry a deletion including both the aniridia candidate gene (AN2) and the Wilms tumor predisposition gene (WT1). This is therefore a rare case of an inherited WAGR deletion. Wilms tumor has so far only been associated with sporadic de novo aniridia cases. We have shown that a cosmid probe for a candidate aniridia gene, homologous to the mouse Pax-6 gene, is deleted in cell lines from aniridia patients with previously characterized deletions at 11p13, while another cosmid marker mapping between two aniridia-associated translocation breakpoints (and hence a second candidate marker) is present on both chromosomes. These results support the Pax-6 homologue as a strong candidate for the AN2 gene. FISH with cosmid probes has proved to be a fast and reliable technique for the molecular analysis of deletions. It can be used with limited amounts of material and has strong potential for clinical applications..

Resolution of the two loci for autosomal dominant aniridia, AN1 and AN2, to a single locus on chromosome 11p13.
Two distinct loci have been proposed for aniridia; AN1 for autosomal dominant aniridia on chromosome 2p and AN2 for the aniridia in the WAGR contiguous gene syndrome on chromosome 11p13. In this report, the kindred segregating for autosomal dominant aniridia, which suggested linkage to acid phosphatase-1 (ACP1) and led to the assignment of the AN1 locus on chromosome 2p, has been updated and expanded. Linkage analysis between the aniridia phenotype and ACP1 does not support the original linkage results, excluding linkage up to theta = 0. 17 with Z = -2. Tests for linkage to other chromosome 2p markers. APOB, D2S71, D2S5, and D2S1, also excluded linkage to aniridia. Markers that have been isolated from the chromosome 11p13 region were then analyzed in this aniridia family. Two RFLPs at the D11S323 locus give significant evidence for linkage. The PvuII polymorphism detected by probe p5S1. 6 detects no recombinants, with a maximum lod score of Z = 6. 97 at theta = 0. 00 00. The HaeIII polymorphism detected by the probe p5BE1. 2 gives a maximum lod score of Z = 2. 57 at theta = 0. 00 00. Locus D11S325 gives a lod score of Z = 1. 53 at theta = 0. 00 00. These data suggest that a locus for aniridia (AN1) on chromosome 2p has been misassigned and that this autosomal dominant aniridia family is segregating for an aniridia mutation linked to markers in the 11p13 region.
