Molecular characterization of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency by natural and amplification created restriction sites: five mutations account for most G6PD deficiency cases in Taiwan.
We have developed a rapid and simple method to diagnose the molecular defects of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in Chinese in Taiwan. This method involves the selective amplification of a DNA fragment from human G6PD gene with specific oligonucleotide primers followed by digestion with restriction enzymes that recognize artificially created or naturally occurring restriction sites. Ninety-four Chinese males with G6PD deficiency were studied. The results show that 50% (47 of 94) were G to T mutation at nucleotide (nt) 1376, 21. 3% (20 of 94) were G to A mutation at nt 1388, 7. 4% (7 of 94) were A to G mutation at nt 493, 7. 4% (7 of 94) were A to G mutation at nt 95, 4. 2% (4 of 94) were C to T mutation at nt 1024, 1. 1% (1 of 94) was G to T mutation at nt 392, and 1. 1% (1 of 94) was G to A mutation at nt 487. These results show that the former five mutations account for more than 90% of G6PD deficiency cases in Taiwan. Aside from showing that G to T change at nt 1376 is the most common mutation, our research indicates that nt 493 mutation is a frequent mutation among Chinese in Taiwan. We compared G6PD activity among different mutations, without discovering significant differences between them.

Heterogeneity of "Mediterranean type" glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in Spain and description of two new variants associated with favism.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD); EC 1. 1. 1. 49 from thirty-six unrelated Spanish males was partially purified from blood, and the variants were characterized biochemically and electrophoretically according to the methods recommended by the world Health Organization. Subjects were from multiple geographic regions within Spain, and all suffered from hemolytic anemia, either acute (34 cases) or chronic nonspherocytic (2 cases). Almost all the variants studied presented residual erythrocyte G6PD activity ranging from 0 to 10% of normal, and five different mutants were responsible for the deficient phenotype. Three variants were similar to others previously described  G6PD Mediterranean (11 cases), G6PD Athens-like (3 cases), and G6PD Union (2 cases). The remaining variants were different from the numerous variants already reported and have been considered as new mutants. Provisionally they are called G6PD Betica (19 cases) and G6PD Menorca (1 case). The present study constitutes the first attempt to characterize the deficient G6PD variants found in Spain and supplies new data on the relationship between molecular characteristics of deficient variants and their clinical manifestations. The most important findings can be summarized as follows  (1) The Spanish population is characterized by an important heterogeneity in G6PD deficiency. (2) Although G6PD Mediterranean is very frequent, it presents a relatively high degree of polymorphism. (3) Favism has been observed associated with all kinds of variants described here. (4) G6PD Betica, which is the most frequent variant found in subjects of Southern Spanish origin, has been observed associated with favism in all cases except one.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency inhibits in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1. 1. 1. 49) -deficient red blood cells from male hemizygotes and female heterozygotes from the island of Sardinia were studied for their ability to support growth in vitro of the malaria-causing organism Plasmodium falciparum. Parasite growth was approximately one-third of normal in both hemi- and heterozygotes for G6PD deficiency. In Sardinians with the beta 0-thalassemia trait, parasite growth was normal except when G6PD deficiency occurred together with the thalassemia trait. The data support the hypothesis that G6PD deficiency may confer a selective advantage in a malarious area; the female heterozygote may be at a particular advantage because resistance to malaria equals that of male hemizygotes, but the risk of fatal hemolysis may be less. However, more female heterozygotes must be studied to confirm this hypothesis. No protective effect of beta 0-thalassemia trait could be demonstrated in vitro.

New genetic variants of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in Italy.
Six new variants of human erythrocyte G6PD have been characterized. All of them were found in Italian males and all were associated with enzyme deficiency, but only two with signs of haemolysis. These and other variants reported in the literature, which must thus far be regarded as sporadic, are found to map in parts of Italy where common types of G6PD deficiency are also prevalent..

Diverse point mutations in the human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene cause enzyme deficiency and mild or severe hemolytic anemia.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1. 1. 1. 49) deficiency is a common genetic abnormality affecting an estimated 400 million people worldwide. Clinical and biochemical analyses have identified many variants exhibiting a range of phenotypes, which have been well characterized from the hematological point of view. However, until now, their precise molecular basis has remained unknown. We have cloned and sequenced seven mutant G6PD alleles. In the nondeficient polymorphic African variant G6PD A we have found a single point mutation. The other six mutants investigated were all associated with enzyme deficiency. In one of the commonest, G6PD Mediterranean, which is associated with favism among other clinical manifestations, a single amino acid replacement was found (serine----phenylalanine)  it must be responsible for the decreased stability and the reduced catalytic efficiency of this enzyme. Single point mutations were also found in G6PD Metaponto (Southern Italy) and in G6PD Ilesha (Nigeria), which are asymptomatic, and in G6PD Chatham, which was observed in an Indian boy with neonatal jaundice. In G6PD " Matera, " which is now known to be the same as G6PD A-, two separate point mutations were found, one of which is the same as in G6PD A. In G6PD Santiago, a de novo mutation (glycine----arginine) is associated with severe chronic hemolytic anemia. The mutations observed show a striking predominance of C----T transitions, with CG doublets involved in four of seven cases. Thus, diverse point mutations may account largely for the phenotypic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency.

[Genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency: mutant alleles of G6PD in the Shekii district of Azerbaijan]
Examination on G6PD deficiency in 349 patients of Shekii district hospital (Azerbaijan) revealed 16 hemi-, 4 homo- and 9 heterozygotic carriers of the defect. Gd- frequency, calculated from the data obtained (7. 7%), may be compared to neighbouring regions frequencies (6-30%). Carriers of G6PD deficiency are residents of 11 villages located in Alasani-Aphtalan valley, highly endemic with malaria in the past; nearly all marriages are endogamic. Physico-chemical and kinetic study of 10 mutant forms of G6PD, according to WHO program, led to identification of 5 variants of the II class (Shekii, Bideiz, Shirin-Bulakh, Okhut I and Zakataly) and 2 variants of the III class (Okhut II and Martinique-like). Resemblance of the majority of variants in electrophoretic mobility and the level of erythrocyte enzyme activity permit to suggest the existence of a common parental mutant G6PD allele distributed in this area.

In 28 families with G6PD deficiency living in 3 settlements of Shekii district of Azerbaijan 11 G6PD variants of II and III classes differing by kinetic properties were identified according WHO program. 9 of them are characterized with the same electrophoretic mobility. Comparison of G6PD spectra in two subpopulations and in a mixed group permits to make a conclusion about existence of common and rare G6PD alleles in examined population. They distribute by gene drift supported by natural selection. Among 7 samples of G6PD with normal and increased activity two new variants of IV class -- Nukha and Bash-Kungut -- were found..

Molecular characterization of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in patients of Chinese descent and identification of new base substitutions in the human G6PD gene.
The underlying DNA changes associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) -deficient Asians have not been extensively investigated. To fill this gap, we sequenced the G6PD gene of 43 G6PD-deficient Chinese whose G6PD was well characterized biochemically. DNA samples were obtained from peripheral blood of these individuals for sequencing using a direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing procedure. From these 43 samples, we have identified five different types of nucleotide substitutions in the G6PD gene  at cDNA 1388 from G to A (Arg to His); at cDNA 1376 from G to T (Arg to Leu); at cDNA 1024 from C to T (Leu to Phe); at cDNA 392 from G to T (Gly to Val); at cDNA 95 from A to G (His to Arg). These five nucleotide substitutions account for over 83% of our 43 G6PD-deficient samples and these substitutions have not been reported in non-Asians. The substitutions found at cDNA 392 and cDNA 1024 are new findings. The substitutions at cDNA 1376 and 1388 account for over 50% of the 43 samples examined indicating a high prevalence of these two alleles among G6PD-deficient Chinese. Our findings add support to the notion that diverse point mutations may account largely for much of the phenotypic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency..

Human mutations in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase reflect evolutionary history.
Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a cytosolic enzyme encoded by a housekeeping X-linked gene whose main function is to produce NADPH, a key electron donor in the defense against oxidizing agents and in reductive biosynthetic reactions. Inherited G6PD deficiency is associated with either episodic hemolytic anemia (triggered by fava beans or other agents) or life-long hemolytic anemia. We show here that an evolutionary analysis is a key to understanding the biology of a housekeeping gene. From the alignment of the amino acid (aa) sequence of 52 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) species from 42 different organisms, we found a striking correlation between the aa replacements that cause G6PD deficiency in humans and the sequence conservation of G6PD  two-thirds of such replacements are in highly and moderately conserved (50-99%) aa; relatively few are in fully conserved aa (where they might be lethal) or in poorly conserved aa, where presumably they simply would not cause G6PD deficiency. This is consistent with the notion that all human mutants have residual enzyme activity and that null mutations are lethal at some stage of development. Comparing the distribution of mutations in a human housekeeping gene with evolutionary conservation is a useful tool for pinpointing amino acid residues important for the stability or the function of the corresponding protein. In view of the current explosive increase in full genome sequencing projects, this tool will become rapidly available for numerous other genes..

Further evidence for heterogeneity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in Papua New Guinea.
Four new G6PD variants have been characterized in individuals from Papua New Guinea. This study demonstrates that the previously reported Markham variant and the newly characterized Salata variant may be widely distributed in Papua New Guinea. Th data presented here together with those of previously published studies demonstrate a degree of heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency that is much higher than that in other regions of the world where G6PD deficiency is common..

Natural selection of hemi- and heterozygotes for G6PD deficiency in Africa by resistance to severe malaria.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the most common enzymopathy of humans, affects over 400 million people. The geographical correlation of its distribution with the historical endemicity of malaria suggests that this disorder has risen in frequency through natural selection by malaria. However, attempts to confirm that G6PD deficiency is protective in case-control studies of malaria have yielded conflicting results. Hence, for this X-linked disorder, it is unclear whether both male hemizygotes and female heterozygotes are protected or, as frequently suggested, only females. Furthermore, how much protection may be afforded is unknown. Here we report that, in two large case-control studies of over 2, 000 African children, the common African form of G6PD deficiency (G6PD A-) is associated with a 46-58% reduction in risk of severe malaria for both female heterozygotes and male hemizygotes. A mathematical model incorporating the measured selective advantage against malaria suggests that a counterbalancing selective disadvantage, associated with this enzyme deficiency, has retarded its rise in frequency in malaria-endemic regions. Although G6PD deficiency is now regarded as a generally benign disorder, in earlier environmental conditions it could have been significantly disadvantageous..

Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants: Gd (+) Alexandra associated with neonatal jaundice and Gd (-) Camperdown in a young man with lamellar cataracts.
Two male subjects are described, with unusual clinical presentations and with hitherto undescribed G6PD variants. The first, of Italian extraction, suffered from severe neonatal jaundice following maternal ingestion of fresh broad beans (Vicia fava) both prenatally and postnatally  the expression of the enzymatic defect was much more severe in the neonatal period than on retesting in adolescence, when biochemical characterization showed unique features which justify designation as a new variant Gd (+) Alexandra. The second patient, a boy of Maltese extraction who was found to have bilateral lamellar cataracts at the age of 4 years, was identified as G6PD deficient only as a result of a survey of children of Mediterranean origin with unexplained cataract formation; he has approximately 15% of normal enzyme activity, with another unique combination of biochemical characteristics which has led to its designation as Gd (-) Camperdown. Although this association may be coincidental, it prompts further attention to the possibility that under certain circumstances G6PD deficiency may favor cataract formation. The two cases illustrate the value of characterization of the mutant enzyme whenever unexpected clinical or laboratory results are obtained..

Genetic heterogeneity at the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase locus in southern Italy: a study on a population from the Matera district.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) has been analyzed by gel electrophoresis and by quantitative assay in an unselected sample of 1524 schoolboys from the province of Matera (Lucania) in southern Italy. We have identified 43 subjects with a G6PD variant. Of these, 31 had severe G6PD deficiency, nine had mild to moderate deficiency, and three had a non-deficient electrophoretic variant. The overall rate of G6PD deficiency was 2. 6%. The frequency of G6PD deficiency, ranging from 7. 2% on the Ionian Coast to zero on the eastern side of the Lucanian Apennines, appears to be inversely related to the distance of each town examined from the Ionian Coast, suggesting that this geographic distribution may reflect, at least in part, gene flow from Greek settlers. Biochemical characterization has shown that most of the G6PD deficiency in this population is accounted for by G6PD Mediterranean. In addition, we have found several examples of two other known polymorphic variants (G6PD Cagliari and G6PD A-); three new polymorphic variants, G6PD Metaponto (class III), G6PD Montalbano (class III), and G6PD Pisticci (class IV); and two sporadic variants, G6PD Tursi (class III) and G6PD Ferrandina (class II). These data provide further evidence for the marked genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency within a relatively narrow geographic area and they prove the presence in the Italian peninsula of a gene (GdA-) regarded as characteristically African.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants and their frequency in Guangdong, China.
Erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was characterized in blood samples obtained from 97 randomly selected males with enzyme deficiency from various regions of Guangdong Province, China. Nine new variants (Gd Kaiping, Gd Boluo, Gd Huiyang, Gd Gaomin, Gd Qing-Baijiang, Gd Gaozhou, Gd Huazhou, Gd Nanhai, and Gd Guangzhou) were identified. Of the 31 variants found in this province, Gd Kaiping, Gd Taiwan-Hakka, Gd Haad Yai, Gd Haad Yai-like and Gd Huiyang occurred most frequently. The frequency of each variant was calculated. The results demonstrated that the genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency was high in this area..

Diverse point mutations result in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) polymorphism in Taiwan.
Glucose-6-PHOSPHATE dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1.1. 1. 49) deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. Although greater than 400 variants have been described based on clinical and biochemical criteria, little is known about the molecular basis of these G6PD deficiencies. Recently, the gene that encodes human G6PD has been cloned and sequenced, which enables us to examine directly the heterogeneity of G6PD at the DNA level. During the past 10 years, we examined the G6PD activity in 21, 271 newborn Chinese infants (11, 400 males and 9, 871 females) and identified 314 (2. 8%) males and 246 (2. 5%) females having low G6PD activity. The G6PD gene from 10 randomly selected affected individuals and their relatives was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified, subcloned, and sequenced. Our results indicate that at least four types of mutation are responsible for the G6PD polymorphism in Taiwan. The first type of mutation (487 G----A) was found in an affected Chinese with a G to A change at nucleotide 487, which results in a (163) Gly to Ser substitution. The second type of mutation (493 A----G) is a novel mutation that has not been reported in any other ethnic group and was identified in two affected Chinese. This mutation causes an A to G change at nucleotide position 493, producing an (165) Asn to Asp substitution. Interestingly, the 487 G----A and 493 A----G mutations create Alu I and Ava II recognition sites, respectively, which enabled us to rapidly detect these two mutations by PCR/restriction enzyme (RE) digestion method. The third mutation (1376 G----T) was found in four affected Chinese. This mutation causes a G to T change at nucleotide position 1376 that results in an (459) Arg to Leu substitution. The 1376 G----T mutation seems to be the dominant allele that causes G6PD deficiency in Taiwan. Finally, two affected Chinese were identified as having the fourth mutation (1388 G----A). This mutation causes a G to A change at nucleotide 1388 that produces an (463) Arg to His substitution. Our studies provide the direct proof of the genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency in the Chinese populations of Taiwan and the PCR/RE digestion method is suitable for simultaneous detection of the 487 G----A and 493 A----G mutations.

Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and incidence of hematologic malignancy.
We have evaluated the hypothesis of a negative association between glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and cancer in a cohort of 481 Sardinian males with hematological malignancies. The frequency of G6PD deficiency in the patients was not different from the incidence in a group of 16, 219 controls. The same conclusion resulted from the comparison of the frequency of expression of the GdB gene in 23 heterozygous women having a clonal hematologic disease and a control group of 37 healthy heterozygotes. Therefore at present there is no evidence that G6PD deficiency has a protective effect against development of hematologic neoplasms..

X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in Mus musculus.
A mouse with X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency has been recovered in offspring of 1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea-treated male mice. The activity alteration was detected in blood but can also be observed in other tissue extracts. Hemizygous, heterozygous, and homozygous mutants have, respectively, about 15, 60, and 15% G6PD remaining activity in the blood as compared to the wild type. Erythrocyte indices did not show differences between mutants and wild types. The mutation does not affect the electrophoretic migration, the isoelectric point, or the thermal stability. Kinetic properties, such as the Km for glucose-6-phosphate or for NADP and the relative utilization of substrate analogues, showed no differences between wild types and mutants with the exception of the relative utilization of deamino-NADP which was significantly lower in mutants. This is presently the only animal model for X-linked G6PD deficiency in humans..

Corinth-like and Fayoum-like variants were the most frequent; Mediterranean, Ohut II, Kilgore, Boston, Poznan, and Panay variants and two new variants, Petrich and Gotze Delchev, were each found in one or two carriers. No correlation was revealed between clinical and biochemical polymorphism..

Heterogeneity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in Algeria. Study in Northern Algeria with description of five new variants.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was found in 3. 2% of the male population living in the urban area of Algiers. The deficient subjects originated from multiple geographic regions of Northern Algeria, with prevalence of individuals of Berber-Kabyle origin. Red blood cell G6PD was partially purified and characterized in deficient males from 17 families, and six different variants were found. Among them, only one, the Gd (-) Kabyle variant, had been previously described. It was detected in nine families. The other five variants were new  Gd (-) Laghouat (four cases), Gd (-) Blida (one case), Gd (-) Thenia (one case), Gd (-) Titteri (one case), and Gd (-) Alger (two brothers). Strikingly, the common Mediterranean variant was not found. G6PD deficiency is heterogeneous in northern Algeria where autochtonous variants seem to prevail. The Kabyle variant may be common in this country.

Two new variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase associated with hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia: G6PD Wayne and G6PD Huron.
Two new deficient variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) causing hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) are described. Both of these are unique and they have been named G6PD Wayne and G6PD Huron. Patients with G6PD Wayne underwent splenectomy and no objective improvement was noted. The patients with G6PD Huron were under medical observation for a considerable period of time without the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency being entertained because the family was of Northern European origin. Since sporadic variants of G6PD causing HNSHA show no special racial predilection, the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency should always be considered in patients with this syndrome..

Some Mexican glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants revisited.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency appears to be fairly common in Mexico. We have now examined the DNA of three previously reported electrophoretically fast Mexican G6PD variants, -G6PD Distrito Federal, G6PD Tepic, and G6PD Castilla. All three of these variants, believed on the basis of biochemical characterization and population origin to be unique, have the G----A transition at nucleotide 202 and the A----G transition at nucleotide 376, mutations that we now recognize to be characteristic of G6PD A-. Two other Mexican males with G6PD deficiency were found to have the same mutation. All five have the (NlaIII/FokI/PvuII/PstI) haplotype characteristic of G6PD A -in Africa. Since the PvuII + genotype seems to be rare in Europe, we conclude that all of these G6PD A - genes had their ancient origin in Africa, although in many of the Mexican patients with G6PD A -202A/376G the gene may have been imported more recently from Spain, where this variant, formerly known as G6PD Betica, is also prevalent..

Molecular genetics of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) Mediterranean variant and description of a new G6PD mutant, G6PD Andalus1361A.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; E. C. 1. 1. 1. 49) deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy; more than 300 different biochemical variants of the enzyme have been described. In many parts of the world the Mediterranean type of G6PD deficiency is prevalent. However, G6PD Mediterranean has come to be regarded as a generic term applied to similar G6PD mutations thought, however, to represent a somewhat heterogeneous group. A C----T mutation at nucleotide 563 of G6PD Mediterranean has been identified by Vulliamy et al., and the same mutation has been found by De Vita et al. in G6PD Mediterranean, G6PD Sassari, and G6PD Cagliari. The latter subjects had an additional mutation, at nucleotide 1311, that did not produce a coding change. We have examined genomic DNA of five patients--four of Spanish origin and one of Jewish origin--having enzymatically documented G6PD Mediterranean. All had both the mutation at nucleotide 563 and that at nucleotide 1311. A sixth sample, resembling G6PD Mediterranean kinetically but with a slightly rapid electrophoretic mobility, was designated G6PD Andalus and was found to have a different mutation, a G----A transition at nucleotide 1361, producing an arginine-to-histidine substitution. These studies suggest that G6PD Mediterranean is, after all, relatively homogeneous.

Genetic polymorphism of G6PD in a Bulgarian population.
Considerable genetic heterogeneity in G6PD was found in the Bulgarian population-14 G6PD variants isolated from 117 hemizygous carriers of G6PD deficiency. Of these, G6PD Mediterranean type was a polymorphic variant and G6PD Corinth occurred with high frequency. Two new variants were identified-G6PD Rudosem and G6PD Nedelino. In a selected group of 78 subjects with clinical manifestations, four variants were established  G6PD Mediterranian, G6PD Corinth, G6PD Seattle and G6PD Ohut II..

A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant (G6PD Nagano) associated with congenital hemolytic anemia.
A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variant associated with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia was reported. The patient, a 6-year-old Japanese male, was noticed to have hemolytic anemia soon after birth, and a diagnosis of G6PD deficiency was made at the age of 2. He had episodes of hemolytic crisis several times after upper respiratory infection. G6PD activity of the patient was 5. 5% of normal. The enzymatic characteristics were examined when he was 5 years old, and his G6PD showed faster-than-normal electrophoretic mobility, low Km G6P, high Km NADP, low Ki NADPH, normal utilization of substrate analogues, heat instability, and a normal pH optimum curve. From these results, this was considered to be a new variant and was designated G6PD Nagano. Infection-induced hemolysis and chronic hemolytic anemia seem to be due to markedly impaired enzyme activity and thermal instability.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants from Italian subjects associated with severe neonatal jaundice.
Screening for the G6PD deficiency was carried out at the Maternity Division of the Galliera Hospital in Genoa, Italy. Two groups of subjects with hyperbilirubinaemia of non-immunological origin were examined  (a) 302 newborn babies of Sardinian extraction (on cord blood) and (b) 201 newborn babies of south Italian ancestry (on peripheral blood). Among 503 subjects, 43 showed an enzyme deficiency; in 39 the defect was of the Mediterranean type. In one case, previously described, the enzyme was of the A- type. In the remaining cases three different variants were identified. In the present work these three cases, each with severe neonatal jaundice, are reported. Their parents originated from Calabria, from Sardinia and from Sicily. The abnormal enzymes are respectively designated as GdDcbrousse-like, GdGallura and GdAgrigento..

Two point mutations are responsible for G6PD polymorphism in Sardinia.
The human X-linked gene encoding glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is highly polymorphic; more than 300 G6PD variants have been identified. G6PD deficiency in different geographical areas appears to have arisen through independent mutational events, but within the same population it may also be heterogeneous. One example is the island of Sardinia, where careful clinical and biochemical studies have identified four different G6PD variants. We cloned and sequenced the four G6PD variants from Sardinia and found that only two mutations are responsible for G6PD deficiency in this area  one mutation is the cause of the G6PD Seattle-like phenotype, a milder form of G6PD deficiency; the other mutation is responsible for all forms of very severe G6PD deficiency in Sardinia and, possibly, in the Mediterranean..

Chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in a patient with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). Molecular study of a new variant (G6PD Clinic) with markedly acidic pH optimum.
A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variant with severe erythrocytic G6PD deficiency and a unique pH optimum is described in a young patient with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). Chronic hemolysis was present in the absence of infections, oxidant drugs or ingestion of faba beans. Residual enzyme activity was about 2. 6% and 63% of normal activity in erythrocytes and leucocytes, respectively. A molecular study using standard methods showed G6PD in the patient to have normal electrophoretic mobility (at pH 7. 0, 8. 0 and 8. 8), normal apparent affinity for substrates (Km, G6P and NADP) and a slightly abnormal utilization of substrate analogues (decreased deamino-NADP and increased 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate utilization). Heat stability was found to be markedly decreased (8% of residual activity after 20 min of incubation at 46 degrees C) and a particular characteristic of this enzyme was a biphasic pH curve with a greatly increased activity at low pH. Although molecular characteristics of this variant closely resemble those of G6PD Bangkok and G6PD Duarte, it can be distinguished from these and all other previously reported variants by virtue of its unusual pH curve. Therefore the present variant has been designated G6PD Clinic to distinguish it from other G6PD variants previously described

These electrophoresis used a phosphate buffer system at pH 7. 0, a TRIS-EDTA-borate buffer system at pH 8. 6, and a TRIS-hydrochloride buffer system at pH 8.. Fifteen G6PD-deficient variants were found at the rate of 0. 5% and classified into four groups. As new variants, G6PD Konan, Kamiube, and Kiwa were identified. These three variants had a mild to moderate G6PD deficiency and were not associated with any clinical signs. G6PD Konan had fast electrophoretic mobility as compared with normal levels, G6PD Kiwa had slightly elevated electrophoretic mobility, and G6PD Kamiube had normal electrophoretic mobility. These three variants had normal levels of Km G6P, Km NADP, and Ki NADPH, normal utilizations of both 2-deoxy-G6P and deamino-NAPD, normal heat stability, and a normal pH curve. The other variant was G6PD Ube, which we had previously found in Yamaguchi (Nakashima et al., 1977). One boy with G6PD Ube was Korean

A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant, G6PD Orissa (44 Ala-->Gly), is the major polymorphic variant in tribal populations in India.
Deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is usually found at high frequencies in areas of the world where malaria has been endemic. The frequency and genetic basis of G6PD deficiency have been studied in Africa, around the Mediterranean, and in the Far East, but little such information is available about the situation in India. To determine the extent of heterogeneity of G6PD, we have studied several different Indian populations by screening for G6PD deficiency, followed by molecular analysis of deficient alleles. The frequency of G6PD deficiency varies between 3% and 15% in different tribal and urban groups. Remarkably, a previously unreported deficient variant, G6PD Orissa (44 Ala-- > Gly), is responsible for most of the G6PD deficiency in tribal Indian populations but is not found in urban populations, where most of the G6PD deficiency is due to the G6PD Mediterranean (188 Ser-- > Phe) variant. The KmNADP of G6PD Orissa is fivefold higher than that of the normal enzyme. This may be due to the fact that the alanine residue that is replaced by glycine is part of a putative coenzyme-binding site..

Increased incidence of cataracts in male subjects deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in RBCs was found significantly more frequently in 210 male cataractous patients than in 672 control subjects of Sardinian origin. The frequency of the deficiency was increasingly higher in presenile cataracts. In the G6PD-deficient group, the incidence of cortical and total cataracts was also increased. It is suggested that decrease of the G6PD activity in the lens, which accompanies its deficiency in the erythrocyte, might play a role in the cataracto-genesis of these patients. Moreover, G6PD deficiency should be added to other conditions, such as the galactosemic states and riboflavin deficiency, where cataracts represent a sensitive indicator of metabolic abnormalities of the RBC..

Both mutations in G6PD A- are necessary to produce the G6PD deficient phenotype.
The high prevalence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in African populations is due almost entirely to the enzyme variant A-, which differs from the wild-type G6PD B by two amino acid replacements, 68 Val-- > Met and 126 Asn-- > Asp. The non-deficient polymorphic variant G6PD A contains only the mutation 126 Asn-- > Asp. The frequencies of the G6PD A and of the G6PD A- genes in parts of Africa are both about 0. 2. The 68 Val-- > Met mutation has not been found in a B background. This could be because the 68 Val-- > Met mutation happened to arise in an A gene in the first instance, or because the 68 Val-- > Met mutation alone is not sufficient to cause G6PD deficiency. We have approached this question by producing G6PD B, A, A-, and G6PD 68 Val-- > Met in a bacterial expression system and analysing their biochemical properties. With each single mutation we found a slight decrease in both the specific activity and the yield of enzyme when compared to G6PD B. When both mutations were introduced together, there was a roughly additive effect on specific activity, but a much more drastic effect on enzyme yield (4% of normal). This synergistic effect was also demonstrated on thermal stability, especially at low NADP concentrations. Comparable results were produced when the replacement 119 Gln-- > Glu was studied instead of 126 Asn-- > Asp. We infer that the coexistence of the two mutations is responsible for enzyme deficiency in G6PD A- because they act synergistically in causing instability of the enzyme.

Severe-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency associated with chronic hemolytic anemia, granulocyte dysfunction, and increased susceptibility to infections: description of a new molecular variant (G6PD Barcelona).
Molecular, kinetic, and functional studies were carried out on erythrocytes and leukocytes in a Spanish male with G6PD deficiency, congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA), and increased susceptibility to infections. G6PD activity was absent in patients red cells and was about 2% of normal in leukocytes. Molecular studies using standard methods (WHO, 1967) showed G6PD in the patient to have a slightly fast electrophoretic mobility at pH 8. 0 with otherwise normal properties (heat stability at 46 degrees C, apparent affinity for substrates, optimum pH, and utilization of substrate analogues). Other tests showed the patients granulocytes to engulf latex particles normally, but to have impaired reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium and ferricytochrome-c as well as reduced iodination. Chemotaxis and random migration of the patients granulocytes were normal as were myeloperoxidase, leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP), and ultrastructural features. The molecular characteristics of G6PD in the patient differed from those of all previously reported variants associated with CNSHA, so the present variant was provisionally called G6PD Barcelona to distinguish it from other G6PD variants previously described. Possible mechanisms for the severe deficiency of G6PD in erythrocytes and granulocytes was investigated by studies on the immunologic specific activity of the mutant enzyme.
