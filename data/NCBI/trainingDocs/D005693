A prevalent mutation for galactosemia among black Americans.
OBJECTIVE  To define the mutation causing galactosemia in patients of black American origin who have no galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) activity in erythrocytes but good clinical outcome. METHODS  We discovered a mutation caused by a C-- > T transition at base-pair 1158 of the GALT gene that results in a serine-to-leucine substitution at codon 135 (S135L). We developed a method with which to screen populations for its prevalence. We compared galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase among erythrocytes, leukocytes, and transformed lymphoblasts, as well as total body oxidation of D- (13C) -galactose to 13CO2 among three genotypes for GALT (S135L/S135L, Q188R/Q188R, and Normal/Normal). RESULTS  We found a 48% prevalence of the S135L mutation among 17 black American patients with classic galactosemia and a 1% prevalence in a population of 50 black Americans without galactosemia. The S135L mutation was not found in 84 white patients with G/G galactosemia nor in 87 white control subjects without galactosemia. We found normal whole body oxidation of D- (13C) -galactose by the patient homozygous for S135L and various degrees of enzyme impairment among different tissues. CONCLUSIONS  The S135L mutation in the GALT gene is a prevalent cause of galactosemia among black patients. Because GALT activity varies in different tissues of patients homozygous for S135L, they may have a better clinical outcome than patients who are homozygous for Q188R when both are treated from infancy..

Classical galactosemia and mutations at the galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) gene.
Classical galactosemia is caused by a deficiency in activity of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT), which, in turn, is caused by mutations at the GALT gene. The disorder exhibits considerable allelic heterogeneity and, at the end of 1998, more than 150 different base changes were recorded in 24 different populations and ethnic groups in 15 countries worldwide. The mutations most frequently cited are Q188R, K285N, S135L, and N314D. Q188R is the most common mutation in European populations or in those predominantly of European descent. Overall, it accounts for 60-70% of mutant chromosomes, but there are significant differences in its relative frequency in individual populations. Individuals homoallelic for Q188R tend to have a severe phenotype and this is in keeping with the virtually complete loss of enzyme activity observed in in vitro expression systems. Globally, K285N is rarer, but in many European populations it can be found on 25-40% of mutant chromosomes. It is invariably associated with a severe phenotype. S135L is found almost exclusively in African Americans. In vitro expression results are discrepant, but some individuals carrying S135L appear to exhibit GALT activity in some tissues. Duarte 1 (or Los Angeles) and Duarte 2 (or Duarte) variants carry the same amino acid substitution, N314D, even though D1 is associated with increased erythrocyte GALT activity and D2 with reduced activity. N314D is in linkage disequilibrium with other base changes that differ on the D1 and D2 alleles. N314D does not impair GALT activity in in vitro expression systems. However, there are differences in the abundance of GALT protein in lymphoblastoid cells lines from D2 and D1 individuals. It is unclear whether the specific molecular changes that distinguish the D1 and D2 alleles account for the different activities. The considerable genetic heterogeneity documented to date undoubtedly contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity that is observed in galactosemia. The additional effects of nonallelic variation and other constitutional factors on phenotypic variability remain to be elucidated..

Molecular characterization of galactosemia (type 1) mutations in Japanese.
We characterized two novel mutations of the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) gene in two Japanese patients with GALT deficiency and identified N314D and R333W mutations, previously found in Caucasians. One novel missense mutation was an G-to-A transition in exon 8, resulting in the substitution of arginine by histidine at the codon 231 (R231H). GALT activity of the R231H mutant construct was reduced to 15% of normal controls in a COS cell expression system. The other was a splicing mutation, an A-to-G transition at the 38th nucleotide in exon 3 (318A-- > G), resulting in a 38-bp deletion in the GALT cDNA by activating a cryptic splice acceptor site. In seven Japanese families (14 alleles for classic form and one allele for Duarte variant) with GALT deficiency, the R231H and 318A-- > G mutations were found only on both alleles of the proband. The N314D and R333W mutations were found on one allele each. The Q188R was prevalent in the United States but not in Japanese patients. The N314D mutation was associated with the Duarte variant in Japanese persons, as well as in the United States. We speculate that classic galactosemia mutations appear to differ between Japanese and Caucasian patients. Our limited data set on galactosemia mutations in Japanese suggests that the N314D GALT mutation encoding the Duarte variant arose before Asian and Caucasian people diverged and that classic galactosemia mutations arose and/or accumulated after the divergence of Asian and Caucasian populations..

Molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations and one polymorphism: implications for structure-function analysis of human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase.
We report here the molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations, L74P and F171S, and one polymorphism, S135L, in human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT). Both galactosemia mutations result in reduced enzymatic activity when reconstructed in the cDNA and overexpressed. The polymorphism, in contrast, has near normal activity. Both mutations affect evolutionarily conserved residues, suggesting that they are functionally important, while the polymorphism occurs in a nonconserved domain which is presumably not critical for enzymatic function. The F171S mutation is close to the putative active-site nucleophile. Our data further support the notion of molecular heterogeneity of galactosemia and suggest that galactosemia mutations and GALT polymorphisms may be useful tools in highlighting different functional domains in human GALT..

Molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations: correlation of mutations with highly conserved domains in galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase.
Galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of human galactose metabolism caused by deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). The molecular basis of this disorder is at present not well understood. We report here two missense mutations which result in low or undetectable enzymatic activity. First, we identified at nucleotide 591 a transition which substitutes glutamine 188 by arginine. The mutated glutamine is not only highly conserved in evolution (conserved also in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), but is also two amino acid residues downstream from the active site histidine-proline-histidine triad and results in about 10% of normal enzymatic activity. The arginine 188 mutation is the most common galactosemia mutation characterized to date. It accounts for one-fourth of the galactosemia alleles studied. Second, we report the substitution of arginine 333 by tryptophan, caused by a transition at nucleotide 1025. The area surrounding this missense mutation is the most highly conserved domain in the homologous enzymes from E. coli, yeast, and humans, and this mutation results in undetectable enzymatic activity, suggesting that this is a severe mutation. This second mutation appears to be rare, since it was found only in the patient we sequenced. Our data provide further evidence for the heterogeneity of galactosemia at the molecular level, heterogeneity which might be related to the variable clinical outcome observed in this disorder..
