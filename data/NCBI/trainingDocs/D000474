The human gene for alkaptonuria (AKU) maps to chromosome 3q.
Alkaptonuria (AKU; McKusick no. 203500) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the lack of homogentisic acid oxidase activity. Patients excrete large amounts of homogentisic acid in their urine and a black ochronotic pigment is deposited in their cartilage and collagenous tissues. Ochronosis is the predominant clinical complication of the disease leading to ochronotic arthropathy, dark urine, pigment changes of the skin, and other clinical features. A mutation causing alkaptonuria in the mouse has mapped to chromosome 16. Considering conserved synteny, we were able to map the human gene to chromosome 3q in six alkaptonuria pedigrees of Slovak origin..

Mutational analysis of the HGO gene in Finnish alkaptonuria patients.
Alkaptonuria (AKU), the prototypic inborn error of metabolism, has recently been shown to be caused by loss of function mutations in the homogentisate-1, 2-dioxygenase gene (HGO). So far 17 mutations have been characterised in AKU patients of different ethnic origin. We describe three novel mutations (R58fs, R330S, and H371R) and one common AKU mutation (M368V), detected by mutational and polymorphism analysis of the HGO gene in five Finnish AKU pedigrees. The three novel AKU mutations are most likely specific for the Finnish population and have originated recently..

Analysis of alkaptonuria (AKU) mutations and polymorphisms reveals that the CCC sequence motif is a mutational hot spot in the homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase gene (HGO).
We recently showed that alkaptonuria (AKU) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the homogentisate 1, 2 dioxygenase gene (HGO). Herein we describe haplotype and mutational analyses of HGO in seven new AKU pedigrees. These analyses identified two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (INV4 + 31A-- > G and INV11 + 18A-- > G) and six novel AKU mutations (INV1-1G-- > A, W60G, Y62C, A122D, P230T, and D291E), which further illustrates the remarkable allelic heterogeneity found in AKU. Reexamination of all 29 mutations and polymorphisms thus far described in HGO shows that these nucleotide changes are not randomly distributed; the CCC sequence motif and its inverted complement, GGG, are preferentially mutated. These analyses also demonstrated that the nucleotide substitutions in HGO do not involve CpG dinucleotides, which illustrates important differences between HGO and other genes for the occurrence of mutation at specific short-sequence motifs. Because the CCC sequence motifs comprise a significant proportion (34. 5%) of all mutated bases that have been observed in HGO, we conclude that the CCC triplet is a mutational hot spot in HGO.

Identification of the mutation in the alkaptonuria mouse model.
Alkaptonuria (aku), an inborn error of metabolism caused by the loss of homogentisate 1, 2-dioxygenase (HGD), has been described in a mouse model created by ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis but the mutation in these mice has not previously been identified. We used RT-PCR to amplify the Hgd cDNA from Hgd (aku)/Hgd (aku) mice. Two products shorter than the wild-type product were amplified. Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing were then used to identify the Hgd (aku) mouse mutation, found to be a single base change in a splice donor consensus sequence, causing exon skipping and frame-shifted products. This base change allowed us to create a non-radioactive genotyping assay for this allele.
