Localization of histidase to human chromosome region 12q22----q24.1 and mouse chromosome region 10C2----D1.
The human gene for histidase (histidine ammonia-lyase; HAL), the enzyme deficient in histidinemia, was assigned to human chromosome 12 by Southern blot analysis of human X mouse somatic cell hybrid DNA. The gene was sublocalized to region 12q22----q24. 1 by in situ hybridization, using a human histidase cDNA. The homologous locus in the mouse (Hal) was mapped to region 10C2----D1 by in situ hybridization, using a cell line from a mouse homozygous for a 1. 10 Robertsonian translocation. These assignments extend the conserved syntenic region between human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 10 that includes the genes for phenylalanine hydroxylase, gamma interferon, peptidase, and citrate synthase. The localization of histidase to mouse chromosome 10 suggests that the histidase regulatory locus (Hsd) and the histidinemia mutation (his), which are both known to be on chromosome 10, may be alleles of the histidase structural gene locus.

histidinemia
Histidinemia. Classical and atypical form in siblings.
Two brothers, 6 and 13 years old, had histidinemia. On the basis of clinical and biochemical observations, the younger boy was considered to have a classical type of the disease, while the older boy had an atypical form characterized by partial impairment of the skin histidase activity and a moderately prolonged half-life of blood histidine. The mother is a heterozygous carrier, while the father and sister seem to be normal..
