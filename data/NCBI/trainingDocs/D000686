Late-onset familial Mediterranean fever (FMF): a subset with distinct clinical, demographic, and molecular genetic characteristics.
To determine the prevalence and characterize demographic, clinical, and genetic features of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) of late onset, all patients experiencing their first FMF attack at age 40 years or more were identified using the computerized registry of our FMF clinic, and then thoroughly interviewed and examined. The control group consisted of 40 consecutive FMF patients, who arrived at the FMF clinic for their regular follow-up visit and were 40 years of age or older at the time of the examination. The severity of the disease in patients and controls was determined using a modified score, developed previously. Mutational analysis in the FMF gene was performed using a commercial kit. Only 20 of 4000 (0. 5%) patients had late-onset FMF. These patients were mostly men, of non-North African origin, P < 0. 05 compared to controls. All had abdominal attacks and in most these were the only manifestation of their disease, P < 0. 001 001. None had chronic or prolonged manifestations of FMF, for example, amyloidosis, chronic arthritis, or protracted myalgia, P < 0. 001. The response to treatment was good despite using low colchicine dose, P < 0. 05. The overall severity score indicated a mild disease, P < 0. 001. Mutational analysis revealed absence of M694V homozygosity, P < 0. 01, compared to our regular FMF population. We conclude that the onset of FMF in a late age defines a milder form of disease with typical clinical, demographic, and molecular genetic characteristics 

amyloidosis
Serum amyloid A and P protein genes in familial Mediterranean fever.
Two recent studies have suggested the involvement of serum amyloid A (SAA) and P (APCS) genes in familial Mediterranean fever (MEF). To test the role of SAA and APCS in MEF and MEF-amyloidosis, we studied 17 informative families (15 Armenians, 2 non-Ashkenazi Jews) and 8 MEF patients with amyloidosis using a candidate gene approach. No evidence for any MEF-associated polymorphism was found in any of the 41 Armenian and Jewish MEF patients tested. Our family studies allowed us to rule out tight linkage between SAA and MEF (lod score = -2. 16, theta less than or equal to 0. 06). For APCS we found that the allele frequency in the MEF-amyloidosis patients was similar to that in 18 unrelated MEF patients without amyloidosis and their 33 healthy parents.
