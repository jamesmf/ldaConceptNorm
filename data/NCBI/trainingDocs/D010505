Mutation and haplotype studies of familial Mediterranean fever reveal new ancestral relationships and evidence for a high carrier frequency with reduced penetrance in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever with serositis or synovitis. The FMF gene (MEFV) was cloned recently, and four missense mutations were identified. Here we present data from non-Ashkenazi Jewish and Arab patients in whom we had not originally found mutations and from a new, more ethnically diverse panel. Among 90 symptomatic mutation-positive individuals, 11 mutations accounted for 79% of carrier chromosomes. Of the two mutations that are novel, one alters the same residue (680) as a previously known mutation, and the other (P369S) is located in exon 3. Consistent with another recent report, the E148Q mutation was observed in patients of several ethnicities and on multiple microsatellite haplotypes, but haplotype data indicate an ancestral relationships between non-Jewish Italian and Ashkenazi Jewish patients with FMF and other affected populations. Among approximately 200 anonymous Ashkenazi Jewish DNA samples, the MEFV carrier frequency was 21%, with E148Q the most common mutation. Several lines of evidence indicate reduced penetrance among Ashkenazi Jews, especially for E148Q, P369S, and K695R. Nevertheless, E148Q helps account for recessive inheritance in an Ashkenazi family previously reported as an unusual case of dominantly inherited FMF. The presence of three frequent MEFV mutations in multiple Mediterranean populations strongly suggests a heterozygote advantage in this geographic region.

Exclusion of linkage between familial Mediterranean fever and the human serum amyloid A (SAA) gene cluster.
We studied the relationship between the autosomal recessive trait familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and the serum amyloid A (SAA) genes by comparing alleles of a highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat and a conventional restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in the SAA gene cluster in Israeli FMF kindreds. By haplotype analysis, our data indicate a minimum crossover frequency of 22% between the SAA gene marker and FMF. By conventional linkage analysis this eliminates a minimum of 10. 4 cM including and surrounding the SAA gene cluster as the site of the FMF mutation although SAA proteins are prominent physiologic markers of the acute attacks.

Isolation, genomic organization, and expression analysis of the mouse and rat homologs of MEFV, the gene for familial mediterranean fever.
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever with serositis or synovitis. Recently the FMF gene (MEFV) was cloned; the protein product, pyrin/marenostrin, is thought to regulate inflammation in myeloid cells. In this manuscript we report the mouse and rat homologs of MEFV. The murine gene contains ten exons with a coding sequence of 2304 bp, while the rat homolog has nine exons with a coding sequence of 2253 bp. A considerable amino acid sequence homology was observed between the mouse and human (47. 6% identity and 65. 5% similarity) and between the mouse and rat genes (73. 5% identity and 82. 1% similarity). The predicted rodent proteins have several important domains and signals found in human pyrin, including a B-box zinc finger domain, Robbins-Dingwall nuclear localization signal, and coiled-coil domain. However, perhaps because of an ancient frame-shift mutation, neither the mouse nor the rat protein has an intact C-terminal B30. 2 domain, in which most FMF-associated mutations have been found in human MEFV. Nevertheless, like the human gene, mouse Mefv is expressed in peripheral blood granulocytes but not lymphocytes. Consistent with its expression in granulocytes, Mefv was detected at high levels in the primary follicles and marginal zones of the splenic white pulp. Mefv is localized on mouse Chromosome (Chr) 16, region A3-B1, extending a region of synteny with human Chr 16p13. 3. Development of knockout and knockin mouse models may provide further insights into the functional evolution of this gene.

MEFV-Gene analysis in armenian patients with Familial Mediterranean fever: diagnostic value and unfavorable renal prognosis of the M694V homozygous genotype-genetic and therapeutic implications.
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessively inherited disorder that is common in patients of Armenian ancestry. To date, its diagnosis, which can be made only retrospectively, is one of exclusion, based entirely on nonspecific clinical signs that result from serosal inflammation and that may lead to unnecessary surgery. Renal amyloidosis, prevented by colchicine, is the most severe complication of FMF, a disorder associated with mutations in the MEFV gene. To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV-gene analysis, we investigated 90 Armenian FMF patients from 77 unrelated families that were not selected through genetic-linkage analysis. Eight mutations, one of which (R408Q) is new, were found to account for 93% of the 163 independent FMF alleles, with both FMF alleles identified in 89% of the patients. In several instances, family studies provided molecular evidence for pseudodominant transmission and incomplete penetrance of the disease phenotype. The M694V homozygous genotype was found to be associated with a higher prevalence of renal amyloidosis and arthritis, compared with other genotypes (P =. 0002 and P =. 006, respectively). The demonstration of both the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV analysis and particular modes of inheritance should lead to new ways for management of FMF-including genetic counseling and therapeutic decisions in affected families.

Familial Mediterranean fever in the colchicine era: the fate of one family.
In order to demonstrate the effect of prophylactic colchicine treatment on the natural history of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a family is presented with 6 out of 9 siblings affected by FMF. Each patient represents a different stage of the amyloidotic kidney disease of FMF and the effect of continuous colchicine treatment on its course. Considered together, the members of this family present an almost complete clinical, genetic, and behavioral picture of the disease..

The gene for familial Mediterranean fever, MEFV, is expressed in early leukocyte development and is regulated in response to inflammatory mediators.
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever and neutrophil-mediated serosal inflammation. We recently identified the gene causing FMF, designated MEFV, and found it to be expressed in mature neutrophils, suggesting that it functions as an inflammatory regulator. To facilitate our understanding of the normal function of MEFV, we extended our previous studies. MEFV messenger RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow leukocytes, with differential expression observed among cells by in situ hybridization. CD34 hematopoietic stem-cell cultures induced toward the granulocytic lineage expressed MEFV at the myelocyte stage, concurrently with lineage commitment. The prepromyelocytic cell line HL60 expressed MEFV only at granulocytic and monocytic differentiation. MEFV was also expressed in the monocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1. Among peripheral blood leukocytes, MEFV expression was detected in neutrophils, eosinophils, and to varying degrees, monocytes. Consistent with the tissue specificity of expression, complete sequencing and analysis of upstream regulatory regions of MEFV revealed homology to myeloid-specific promoters and to more broadly expressed inflammatory promoter elements. In vitro stimulation of monocytes with the proinflammatory agents interferon (IFN) gamma, tumor necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharide induced MEFV expression, whereas the antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) 4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor beta inhibited such expression. Induction by IFN-gamma occurred rapidly and was resistant to cycloheximide. IFN-alpha also induced MEFV expression. In granulocytes, MEFV was up-regulated by IFN-gamma and the combination of IFN-alpha and colchicine. These results refine understanding of MEFV by placing the gene in the myelomonocytic-specific proinflammatory pathway and identifying it as an IFN-gamma immediate early gene..

Late-onset familial Mediterranean fever (FMF): a subset with distinct clinical, demographic, and molecular genetic characteristics.
To determine the prevalence and characterize demographic, clinical, and genetic features of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) of late onset, all patients experiencing their first FMF attack at age 40 years or more were identified using the computerized registry of our FMF clinic, and then thoroughly interviewed and examined. The control group consisted of 40 consecutive FMF patients, who arrived at the FMF clinic for their regular follow-up visit and were 40 years of age or older at the time of the examination. The severity of the disease in patients and controls was determined using a modified score, developed previously. Mutational analysis in the FMF gene was performed using a commercial kit. Only 20 of 4000 (0. 5%) patients had late-onset FMF. These patients were mostly men, of non-North African origin, P < 0. 05 compared to controls. All had abdominal attacks and in most these were the only manifestation of their disease, P < 0. 001 001. None had chronic or prolonged manifestations of FMF, for example, amyloidosis, chronic arthritis, or protracted myalgia, P < 0. 001. The response to treatment was good despite using low colchicine dose, P < 0. 05. The overall severity score indicated a mild disease, P < 0. 001. Mutational analysis revealed absence of M694V homozygosity, P < 0. 01, compared to our regular FMF population. We conclude that the onset of FMF in a late age defines a milder form of disease with typical clinical, demographic, and molecular genetic characteristics

Serum amyloid A and P protein genes in familial Mediterranean fever.
Two recent studies have suggested the involvement of serum amyloid A (SAA) and P (APCS) genes in familial Mediterranean fever (MEF). To test the role of SAA and APCS in MEF and MEF-amyloidosis, we studied 17 informative families (15 Armenians, 2 non-Ashkenazi Jews) and 8 MEF patients with amyloidosis using a candidate gene approach. No evidence for any MEF-associated polymorphism was found in any of the 41 Armenian and Jewish MEF patients tested. Our family studies allowed us to rule out tight linkage between SAA and MEF (lod score = -2. 16, theta less than or equal to 0. 06). For APCS we found that the allele frequency in the MEF-amyloidosis patients was similar to that in 18 unrelated MEF patients without amyloidosis and their 33 healthy parents.
