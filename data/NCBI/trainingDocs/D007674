A zinc finger truncation of murine WT1 results in the characteristic urogenital abnormalities of Denys-Drash syndrome .
The Wilms tumor -suppressor gene, WT1, plays a key role in urogenital development, and WT1 dysfunction is implicated in both neoplastic (Wilms tumor, mesothelioma, leukemias, and breast cancer) and nonneoplastic (glomerulosclerosis) disease. The analysis of diseases linked specifically with WT1 mutations, such as Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), can provide valuable insight concerning the role of WT1 in development and disease. DDS is a rare childhood disease characterized by a nephropathy involving mesangial sclerosis, XY pseudohermaphroditism, and/or Wilms tumor (WT). DDS patients are constitutionally heterozygous for exonic point mutations in WT1, which include mutations predicted to truncate the protein within the C-terminal zinc finger (ZF) region. We report that heterozygosity for a targeted murine Wt1 allele, Wt1 (tmT396), which truncates ZF3 at codon 396, induces mesangial sclerosis characteristic of DDS in adult heterozygous and chimeric mice. Male genital defects also were evident and there was a single case of Wilms tumor in which the transcript of the nontargeted allele showed an exon 9 skipping event, implying a causal link between Wt1 dysfunction and Wilms tumorigenesis in mice. However, the mutant WT1 (tmT396) protein accounted for only 5% of WT1 in both heterozygous embryonic stem cells and the WT. This has implications regarding the mechanism by which the mutant allele exerts its effect.

Constitutional mutations in the WT1 gene in patients with Denys-Drash syndrome.
The Denys-Drash syndrome is characterised by a typical nephropathy, genital abnormalities and also predisposes to the development of Wilms tumor. These patients eventually go into end stage renal failure. A candidate Wilms tumor gene, WT1, from the 11p13 chromosome region has recently been cloned. We have analysed the DNA sequence in constitutional cells from eight patients and have shown heterozygous mutations in six of them. Four of the mutations were in exon 9, all resulting in missense mutations. Three were at nucleotide position 1180 resulting in an arg > trp amino acid change. The other was at position 1186 converting an asp > asn in the predicted resultant protein. One patient had a missense mutation in exon 8, converting an arg > his. A single base pair insertion at nucleotide position 821 in exon 6 resulted in the generation of a premature stop codon in the last patient. We were unable to find a mutation in one patient despite complete sequencing of the genomic sequence of the gene. The last patient carried a constitutional deletion of the 11p13 region and no additional mutation was found. There was no obvious correlation between the type of mutation and phenotypic expression. These results further demonstrate that the WT1 gene is important in both the development of the kidney and the genito-urinary system..

Complement deficiency and nephritis. A report of a family.
A family is described in which three children had homozygous deficiency of C3 and in which both parents and two other children were heterozygous for the C3 null gene. One child with heterozygous C3 deficiency was found to have membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; proteinuria and/or microscopical haematuria was present in all three homozygous C3-deficient children. All children with homozygous or heterozygous C3 deficiency were, to a varying degree, susceptible to infection. The only child of the family with normal complement had no increased risk of infection and no renal disease. This family study provides further support for the proposal that C3 deficiency predisposes to nephritis..

Familial Mediterranean fever in the colchicine era: the fate of one family.
In order to demonstrate the effect of prophylactic colchicine treatment on the natural history of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a family is presented with 6 out of 9 siblings affected by FMF. Each patient represents a different stage of the amyloidotic kidney disease of FMF and the effect of continuous colchicine treatment on its course. Considered together, the members of this family present an almost complete clinical, genetic, and behavioral picture of the disease..

Inherited WT1 mutation in Denys-Drash syndrome.
Patients with the Denys-Drash syndrome (Wilms tumor, genital anomalies, and nephropathy) have been demonstrated to carry de novo constitutional mutations in WT1, the Wilms tumor gene at chromosome 11p13. We report three new cases, two carrying a previously described WT1 exon 9 mutation and one with a novel WT1 exon 8 mutation. However, unlike patients in previous reports, one of our three patients inherited the affected allele from his phenotypically unaffected father. This observation indicates that the WT1 exon 9 mutation affecting 394Arg demonstrated in over one-half of the patients with the Denys-Drash syndrome may exhibit incomplete penetrance. Consequently, familial studies in patients affected by this syndrome are recommended..

Nephropathy in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
Nephropathy was detected in five of 32 patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome who were participating in a study of transfer factor (TF) therapy. In two patients, nephropathy was present before TF and did not appear changed by TF therapy. One of these patients subsequently developed progressive renal failure requiring dialysis beginning 5 1/2 years after TF therapy. In two patients, decreased renal function appeared very soon after the administration of TF. One patient showed gradually decreasing renal function beginning after two years of TF therapy. An additional patient was identified who died with renal failure without having received TF. The results suggest that renal failure occurs in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome more frequently than generally recognized and that administration of TF may precipitate or accelerate the renal disease in patients with this syndrome..
