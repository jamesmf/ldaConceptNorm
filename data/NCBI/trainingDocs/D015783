Autosomal dominant aniridia linked to the chromosome 11p13 markers catalase and D11S151 in a large Dutch family.
In a large pedigree with autosomal dominant aniridia, we found close linkage between the aniridia locus AN2 and the markers catalase (CAT) (zeta = 7. 27 at theta = 0. 00) and D11S151 (zeta = 3. 86 at theta = 0. 10) flanking the AN2 locus on 11p13. Positive lod scores were also obtained for the 11p13----11p14 markers D11S16 and FSHB with the linkage group CAT/AN2/D11S151. We conclude that the autosomal dominant aniridia in this family is due to a mutation at the AN2 locus on 11p13. We have excluded linkage (zeta less than -2 at theta less than 0. 18) between the aniridia and the chromosome 2p25 marker D2S1 (linked to ACP1).

Translocation t(5;11)(q13.1;p13) associated with familial isolated aniridia.
A father and daughter with isolated aniridia were observed to have an apparently balanced, reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 5 and 11 [t (5; 11) (q13. 1; p13)]. No other clinical characteristics often associated with the deletion of 11p13 were observed in this family. This finding, in association with 3 other instances of single breaks at 11p13 and aniridia, supports the assignment of AN2 to 11p13.

PAX6 gene dosage effect in a family with congenital cataracts, aniridia, anophthalmia and central nervous system defects.
The human eye malformation aniridia results from haploinsufficiency of PAX6, a paired box DNA-binding protein. To study this dosage effect, we characterized two PAX6 mutations in a family segregating aniridia and a milder syndrome consisting of congenital cataracts and late onset corneal dystrophy. The nonsense mutations, at codons 103 and 353, truncate PAX6 within the N-terminal paired and C-terminal PST domains, respectively. The wild-type PST domain activates transcription autonomously and the mutant form has partial activity. A compound heterozygote had severe craniofacial and central nervous system defects and no eyes. The pattern of malformations is similar to that in homozygous Sey mice and suggests a critical role for PAX6 in controlling the migration and differentiation of specific neuronal progenitor cells in the brain..

Three novel aniridia mutations in the human PAX6 gene.
Aniridia (iris hypoplasia) is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder of the eye. Mutations in the human aniridia (PAX6) gene have now been identified in many patients from various ethnic groups. In the study reported here we describe PAX6 mutations in one sporadic and five familial cases with aniridia. Of the four different mutations identified, one was identical to a previously reported mutation (C-- > T transition at codon 240), and three were novel  two in the glycine-rich region and one in the proline/serine/threonine-rich (PST) region. One PAX6 mutation found in the PST region was associated with cataracts in an aniridia family. Another splice mutation in the PST domain occurred in an aniridia patient with anosmia (inability to smell). The six new aniridia cases reported here have mutations predicted to generate incomplete PAX6 proteins. These results support the theory that human aniridia is caused by haploinsufficiency of PAX6..

Cloning of breakpoints of a chromosome translocation identifies the AN2 locus.
Chromosome translocations involving 11p13 have been associated with familial aniridia in two kindreds highlighting the chromosomal localization of the AN2 locus. This locus is also part of the WAGR complex (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation). In one kindred, the translocation is associated with a deletion, and probes for this region were used to identify and clone the breakpoints of the translocation in the second kindred. Comparison of phage restriction maps exclude the presence of any sizable deletion in this case. Sequences at the chromosome 11 breakpoint are conserved in multiple species, suggesting that the translocation falls within the AN2 gene..

Aniridia-associated cytogenetic rearrangements suggest that a position effect may cause the mutant phenotype.
Current evidence suggests that aniridia (absence of iris) is caused by loss of function of one copy of the PAX6 gene, which maps to 11p13. We present the further characterisation of two aniridia pedigrees in which the disease segregates with chromosomal rearrangements which involve 11p13 but do not disrupt the PAX6 gene. We have isolated three human YAC clones which encompass the PAX6 locus and we have used these to show that in both cases the chromosomal breakpoint is at least 85 kb distal of the 3 end of PAX6. In addition, the open reading frame of PAX6 is apparently free of mutations. We propose that the PAX6 gene on the rearranged chromosome 11 is in an inappropriate chromatin environment for normal expression and therefore that a position effect is the underlying mechanism of disease in these families..

Submicroscopic deletions at the WAGR locus, revealed by nonradioactive in situ hybridization.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with biotin-labeled probes mapping to 11p13 has been used for the molecular analysis of deletions of the WAGR (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) locus. We have detected a submicroscopic 11p13 deletion in a child with inherited aniridia who subsequently presented with Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney, only revealed at surgery. The mother, who has aniridia, was also found to carry a deletion including both the aniridia candidate gene (AN2) and the Wilms tumor predisposition gene (WT1). This is therefore a rare case of an inherited WAGR deletion. Wilms tumor has so far only been associated with sporadic de novo aniridia cases. We have shown that a cosmid probe for a candidate aniridia gene, homologous to the mouse Pax-6 gene, is deleted in cell lines from aniridia patients with previously characterized deletions at 11p13, while another cosmid marker mapping between two aniridia-associated translocation breakpoints (and hence a second candidate marker) is present on both chromosomes. These results support the Pax-6 homologue as a strong candidate for the AN2 gene. FISH with cosmid probes has proved to be a fast and reliable technique for the molecular analysis of deletions. It can be used with limited amounts of material and has strong potential for clinical applications..

Resolution of the two loci for autosomal dominant aniridia, AN1 and AN2, to a single locus on chromosome 11p13.
Two distinct loci have been proposed for aniridia; AN1 for autosomal dominant aniridia on chromosome 2p and AN2 for the aniridia in the WAGR contiguous gene syndrome on chromosome 11p13. In this report, the kindred segregating for autosomal dominant aniridia, which suggested linkage to acid phosphatase-1 (ACP1) and led to the assignment of the AN1 locus on chromosome 2p, has been updated and expanded. Linkage analysis between the aniridia phenotype and ACP1 does not support the original linkage results, excluding linkage up to theta = 0. 17 with Z = -2. Tests for linkage to other chromosome 2p markers. APOB, D2S71, D2S5, and D2S1, also excluded linkage to aniridia. Markers that have been isolated from the chromosome 11p13 region were then analyzed in this aniridia family. Two RFLPs at the D11S323 locus give significant evidence for linkage. The PvuII polymorphism detected by probe p5S1. 6 detects no recombinants, with a maximum lod score of Z = 6. 97 at theta = 0. 00 00. The HaeIII polymorphism detected by the probe p5BE1. 2 gives a maximum lod score of Z = 2. 57 at theta = 0. 00 00. Locus D11S325 gives a lod score of Z = 1. 53 at theta = 0. 00 00. These data suggest that a locus for aniridia (AN1) on chromosome 2p has been misassigned and that this autosomal dominant aniridia family is segregating for an aniridia mutation linked to markers in the 11p13 region.

PAX6 mutations in aniridia.
Aniridia is a congenital malformation of the eye, chiefly characterised by iris hypoplasia, which can cause blindness. The PAX6 gene was isolated as a candidate aniridia gene by positional cloning from the smallest region of overlap of aniridia-associated deletions. Subsequently PAX6 intragenic mutations were demonstrated in Smalleye, a mouse mutant which is an animal model for aniridia, and six human aniridia patients. In this paper we describe four additional PAX6 point mutations in aniridia patients, both sporadic and familial. These mutations highlight regions of the gene which are essential for normal PAX6 function. In addition, the frequency at which we have found PAX6 mutations suggests that lesions in PAX6 will account for most cases of aniridia..

Mutations in the PAX6 gene in patients with hereditary aniridia.
The 14 exons of the PAX6 gene have been analysed exon-by-exon using SSCP in 6 aniridia families. In each family band shifts were observed on the SSCP gels for only one exon and direct PCR-sequencing revealed mutations in each case. Two mutations involved C-- > T transitions in CGAarg codons in exons 9 and 11. Another C-- > T transition converted a CAG-glutamine to a TAG-stop in exon 7. Small insertions created frameshifts which produced downstream stop codons in another two patients and an A-- > T mutation disrupted the splice donor site of exon 5 in the remaining family. Thus, complete inactivation of the PAX6 gene is predicted in all cases. Analysis of other affected members of the families showed that, in each case, all affected individuals carried the same family-specific mutation. One polymorphism was found in exon 7. This data strongly supports the candidature of PAX6 as the gene responsible for hereditary aniridia..

Missense mutation in the alternative splice region of the PAX6 gene in eye anomalies.
The PAX6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis, and PAX6 mutations have been detected in various types of ocular anomalies, including aniridia, Peters anomaly, corneal dystrophy, congenital cataract, and foveal hypoplasia. The gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its paired-type DNA-binding domain. The paired domain is composed of two distinct DNA-binding subdomains, the N-terminal subdomain (NTS) and the C-terminal subdomain (CTS), which bind respective consensus DNA sequences. The human PAX6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain. The insertion, into the NTS, of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the DNA-binding activity of the NTS and unmasks the DNA-binding ability of the CTS. Thus, exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes. We ascertained a novel missense mutation in four pedigrees with Peters anomaly, congenital cataract, Axenfeldt anomaly, and/or foveal hypoplasia, which, to our knowledge, is the first mutation identified in the splice-variant region. A T-- > A transition at the 20th nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a Val-- > Asp (GTC-- > GAC) substitution at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region. Functional analyses demonstrated that the V54D mutation slightly increased NTS binding and decreased CTS transactivation activity to almost half..

Mutations at the PAX6 locus are found in heterogeneous anterior segment malformations including Peters' anomaly.
Mutation or deletion of the PAX6 gene underlies many cases of aniridia. Three lines of evidence now converge to implicate PAX6 more widely in anterior segment malformations including Peters anomaly. First, a child with Peters anomaly is deleted for one copy of PAX6. Second, affected members of a family with dominantly inherited anterior segment malformations, including Peters anomaly are heterozygous for an R26G mutation in the PAX6 paired box. Third, a proportion of Sey/+ Smalleye mice, heterozygous for a nonsense mutation in murine Pax-6, have an ocular phenotype resembling Peters anomaly. We therefore propose that a variety of anterior segment anomalies may be associated with PAX6 mutations..
