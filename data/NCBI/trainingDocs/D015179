The type of somatic mutation at APC in familial adenomatous polyposis is determined by the site of the germline mutation: a new facet to Knudson's 'two-hit' hypothesis.
APC is often cited as a prime example of a tumor suppressor gene. Truncating germline and somatic mutations (or, infrequently, allelic loss) occur in tumors in FAP (familial adenomatous polyposis). Most sporadic colorectal cancers also have two APC mutations. Clues from attenuated polyposis, missense germline variants with mild disease and the somatic mutation cluster region (codons 1, 250-1, 450) indicate, however, that APC mutations might not result in simple loss of protein function. We have found that FAP patients with germline APC mutations within a small region (codons 1, 194-1, 392 at most) mainly show allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas, in contrast to other FAP patients, whose second hits tend to occur by truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region. Our results indicate that different APC mutations provide cells with different selective advantages, with mutations close to codon 1, 300 providing the greatest advantage. Allelic loss is selected strongly in cells with one mutation near codon 1, 300. A different germline-somatic APC mutation association exists in FAP desmoids. APC is not, therefore, a classical tumor suppressor. Our findings also indicate a new mechanism for disease severity  if a broader spectrum of mutations is selected in tumors, the somatic mutation rate is effectively higher and more tumors grow..

Eight novel inactivating germ line mutations at the APC gene identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a dominantly inherited condition predisposing to colorectal cancer. The recent isolation of the responsible gene (adenomatous polyposis coli or APC) has facilitated the search for germ line mutations in affected individuals. Previous authors have used the RNase protection assay and the single-strand conformation polymorphisms procedure to screen for mutations. In this study we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE analysis of 10 APC exons (4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and part of 15) in 33 unrelated Dutch FAP patients has led to the identification of eight novel germ line mutations resulting in stop codons or frameshifts. The results reported here indicate that (1) familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of point mutations; (2) all the mutations found in this study are chain terminating; and (3) DGGE represents a rapid and sensitive technique for the detection of mutations in the unusually large APC gene. An extension of the DGGE analysis to the entire coding region in a sufficient number of clinically well-characterized, unrelated patients will facilitate the establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations. On the other hand, the occurrence of an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of mutations spread throughout the entire length of the large APC gene among the FAP patients indicates that this approach may not be useful as a rapid presymptomatic diagnostic procedure in a routine laboratory. Nevertheless, the above DGGE approach has incidentally led to the identification of a common polymorphism in exon 13. Such intragenic polymorphisms offer a practical approach to a more rapid procedure for presymptomatic diagnosis of FAP by linkage analysis in informative families..

The identical 5' splice-site acceptor mutation in five attenuated APC families from Newfoundland demonstrates a founder effect.
Inherited mutations of the APC gene predispose carriers to multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon and rectum and to colorectal cancer. Mutations located at the extreme 5 end of the APC gene, however, are associated with a less severe disease known as attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC). Many individuals with AAPC develop relatively few colorectal polyps but are still at high risk for colorectal cancer. We report here the identification of a 5 APC germline mutation in five separately ascertained AAPC families from Newfoundland, Canada. This disease-causing mutation is a single basepair change (G to A) in the splice-acceptor region of APC intron 3 that creates a mutant RNA without exon 4 of APC. The observation of the same APC mutation in five families from the same geographic area demonstrates a founder effect. Furthermore, the identification of this germline mutation strengthens the correlation between the 5 location of an APC disease-causing mutation and the attenuated polyposis phenotype..

Asef, a link between the tumor suppressor APC and G-protein signaling.
The adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis and in sporadic colorectal tumors. Here the APC gene product is shown to bind through its armadillo repeat domain to a Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), termed Asef. Endogenous APC colocalized with Asef in mouse colon epithelial cells and neuronal cells. Furthermore, APC enhanced the GEF activity of Asef and stimulated Asef-mediated cell flattening, membrane ruffling, and lamellipodia formation in MDCK cells. These results suggest that the APC-Asef complex may regulate the actin cytoskeletal network, cell morphology and migration, and neuronal function..

Adenomatous polyposis coli and a cytogenetic deletion of chromosome 5 resulting from a maternal intrachromosomal insertion.
We present the clinical and laboratory findings in an institutionalised adult patient originally referred for autism. A high risk of colorectal cancer was predicted when an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, del (5) (q15q22. 3), was detected in her lymphocytes and deletion of the MCC and APC genes confirmed by molecular analysis. Adenomatous polyposis coli and carcinoma of the rectum were subsequently diagnosed in the patient. She was profoundly mentally retarded, autistic, and had minor dysmorphic features consistent with those of previous patients with similar deletions. The deletion arose as a result of recombination within the small insertion loop formed at meiosis by the direct insertion (dir ins (5) (q22. 3q14. 2q15)) found in the patients mother. This family further confirms the cytogenetic mapping of both MCC and APC genes to 5q22 and comparison with other recent cases suggests that both genes and their closely linked markers lie within the 5q22. 1 subband

Somatic mutations of the APC gene in colorectal tumors: mutation cluster region in the APC gene.
We examined somatic mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in 63 colorectal tumors (16 adenomas and 47 carcinomas) developed in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and non-FAP patients. In addition to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the APC locus in 30 tumors, 43 other somatic mutations were detected. Twenty-one of them were point mutations; 16 nonsense and two missense mutations, and three occurred in introns at the splicing site. Twenty-two tumors had frameshift mutations due to deletion or insertion; nineteen of them were deletions of one to 31 bp and three were a 1-bp insertion. One tumor had a 1-bp deletion in an intron near the splicing site. Hence, 41 (95%) of 43 mutations resulted in truncation of the APC protein. Over 60% of the somatic mutations in the APC gene were clustered within a small region of exon 15, designated as MCR (mutation cluster region), which accounted for less than 10% of the coding region. Combining these data and the results of LOH, more than 80% of tumors (14 adenomas and 39 carcinomas) had at least one mutation in the APC gene, of which more than 60% (9 adenomas and 23 carcinomas) had two mutations. These results strongly suggest that somatic mutations of the APC gene are associated with development of a great majority of colorectal tumors..

Restriction of ocular fundus lesions to a specific subgroup of APC mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli patients.
In humans, alteration of the tumor suppressor gene, APC, causes adenomatous polyposis coli, a condition causing predisposition to colorectal cancer. The syndrome inconsistently associates characteristic patches of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). Ocular examination revealed that patients expressing CHRPE tend to cluster within specific families. The exact APC mutation was identified in 42 unrelated patients. In all cases these mutations were predicted to lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein. The extent of CHRPE was found to be dependent on the position of the mutation along the coding sequence. CHRPE lesions are almost always absent if the mutation occurs before exon 9, but are systematically present if it occurs after this exon. Thus, the range of phenotypic expression observed among affected patients may result in part from different allelic manifestations of APC mutations..

Malignant neoplasms in the families of patients with ataxia-telangiectasia.
Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive syndrome associated with a greatly increased incidence of malignant neoplasms in homozygous affected individuals. Heterozygotes for the gene for A-T are thought to comprise about 1% of the general population and, therefore, it is important to know whether this gene also predisposes the heterozygous carrier to cancers. Heterozygous carriers of this gene are common among the close relatives of patients with A-T, although individual carriers cannot be identified by any clinical criterion or laboratory test. For this reason, we compared the incidence of death from malignant neoplasms in 2 families of patients with A-T to that expected in a random sample of the general population. There were 59 deaths from malignant neoplasms in relatives dying before age 75, compared to 42. 6 expected (p less than 0. 02). For A-T heterozygotes younger than age 45, the risk of dying from a malignant neoplasm was estimated to be greater than 5 times the risk for the general population. A-T heterozygotes may comprise more than 5% of all persons dying from a cancer before age 45. The incidence of ovarian, gastric, and biliary system carcinomas and of leukemia and lymphoma was increased in these A-T families. Other neoplasms that may be associated with this gene in heterozygotes include pancreatic, basal cell, colonic, breast, and cervical carcinomas.

Genetic linkage map of six polymorphic DNA markers around the gene for familial adenomatous polyposis on chromosome 5.
A genetic linkage map of six polymorphic DNA markers close to the gene (APC) for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) on chromosome 5q is reported. One hundred fifty-five typed members of nine FAP kindred provided more than 90 meioses for linkage analysis. A number of crucial recombination events have been identified which are informative at three or more loci, allowing confident ordering of parts of the map. There was no evidence of genetic heterogeneity, with all families showing linkage of at least one chromosome 5 marker to the gene. Recombination data and two-point linkage analysis support a locus order of centromere-pi 227-C11P11-ECB27-L5. 62-APC-EF5 62-APC-EF5. 44-YN5 44-YN5. 48-telomer e, although EF5. 44 could lie in the interval L5. 62-APC or ECB27-L5. 62. No recombinants were identified between APC and either EF5. 44 or YN5. 48, but published deletion mapping in colorectal carcinomas and linkage analysis in FAP suggest that YN5. 48 is 1-3 cM from APC. The present study suggests that YN5. 48 and L5. 62 delineate a small region of chromosome 5 within which the EF5. 44 locus lies very close to the APC gene. These data not only allow use of flanking markers for presymptomatic diagnosis of FAP but also provide a high-density map of the region for isolation of the APC gene itself and for further assessment of the role of chromosome 5 deletions in the biology of sporadic colorectal cancer.

Association of the APC tumor suppressor protein with catenins.
Mutations of APC appear to initiate sporadic and inherited forms of human colorectal cancer. Although these mutations have been well characterized, little is known about the function of the APC gene product. Two cellular proteins that associate with APC were identified by nucleotide sequence analysis and peptide mapping as the E-cadherin-associated proteins alpha- and beta-catenin. A 27-residue fragment of APC containing a 15-amino acid repeat was sufficient for the interaction with the catenins. These results suggest an important link between tumor initiation and cell adhesion..

Genomic rearrangements of the APC tumor-suppressor gene in familial adenomatous polyposis.
Germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene result in the hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Almost all APC mutations that have been identified are single-nucleotide alterations, small insertions, or small deletions that would truncate the protein product of the gene. No well-characterized intragenic rearrangement of APC has been described, and the prevalence of this type of mutation in FAP patients is not clear. We screened 49 potential FAP families and identified 26 different germline APC mutations in 30 families. Four of these mutations were genomic rearrangements resulting from homologous and nonhomologous recombinations mediated by Alu elements. Two of these four rearrangements were complex, involving deletion and insertion of nucleotides. Of these four rearrangements, one resulted in the deletion of exons 11 and 12 and two others resulted in either complete or partial deletion of exon 14. The fourth rearrangement grossly altered the sequence within intron 14. Although this rearrangement did not affect any coding sequence of APC at the genomic DNA level, it caused inappropriate splicing of exon 14. These rearrangements were initially revealed by analyzing cDNAs and could not have been identified by using mutation detection methods that screened each exon individually. The identification of a rearrangement that did not alter any coding exons yet affected the splicing further underscores the importance of using cDNA for mutation analysis. The identification of four genomic rearrangements among 30 mutations suggests that genomic rearrangements are frequent germline APC mutations..

Inactivation of germline mutant APC alleles by attenuated somatic mutations: a molecular genetic mechanism for attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis.
Germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene result in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Patients with FAP typically develop hundreds to thousands of benign colorectal tumors and early-onset colorectal cancer. A subset of germline APC mutations results in an attenuated FAP (AFAP) phenotype, in which patients develop fewer tumors and develop them at an older age. Although a genotype-phenotype correlation between the locations of APC germline mutations and the development of AFAP has been well documented, the mechanism for AFAP has not been well defined. We investigated the mechanism for AFAP in patients carrying a mutant APC allele (APC (AS9)) that has a mutation in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9. APC (AS9) was found to down-regulate beta-catenin-regulated transcription, the major tumor-suppressor function of APC, as did the wild-type APC. Mutation analysis showed that both APC (AS9) and the wild-type APC alleles were somatically mutated in most colorectal tumors from these patients. Functional analysis showed that 4666insA, a common somatic mutation in APC (AS9) in these tumors, did not inactivate the wild-type APC. Our results indicate that carriers of APC (AS9) develop fewer colorectal tumors than do typical patients with FAP because somatic inactivation of both APC alleles is necessary for colorectal tumorigenesis. However, these patients develop colorectal tumors more frequently than does the general population because APC (AS9) is inactivated by mutations that do not inactivate the wild-type APC..

Yeast artificial chromosomes for the molecular analysis of the familial polyposis APC gene region.
Two yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) spanning a total distance of 1. 1 megabase pairs of DNA around the MCC (for mutated in colorectal carcinoma) and APC (for adenomatous polyposis coli) genes at 5q21 have been isolated and characterized. Starting from the MCC gene, a strategy was undertaken to identify constitutional submicroscopic deletions in familial adenomatous polyposis patients that might considerably narrow down the position of the APC gene. To this end, YACs identified by the MCC gene were screened across a chromosome 5-specific cosmid library to provide a source of DNA probes for genomic scanning. The cosmids isolated from these experiments were used to screen a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing chromosome 5 segregated from patients suspected to carry putative interstitial deletions. This screening approach led to the confirmation of a small heterozygous deletion in a polyposis patient that overlaps one of the two isolated YACs. This YAC has been shown to contain the entire APC gene, in addition to a significant portion of DNA flanking the 5 end of the gene, and should therefore prove a valuable resource for functional studies by transfer to colorectal tumor-derived cell lines.

Function of an axonal chemoattractant modulated by metalloprotease activity.
The axonal chemoattractant netrin-1 guides spinal commissural axons by activating its receptor DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer ). We have found that chemical inhibitors of metalloproteases potentiate netrin-mediated axon outgrowth in vitro. We have also found that DCC is a substrate for metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding, and that the inhibitors block proteolytic processing of DCC and cause an increase in DCC protein levels on axons within spinal cord explants. Thus, potentiation of netrin activity by inhibitors may result from stabilization of DCC on the axons, and proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration by controlling the number of functional extracellular axon guidance receptors..

A common MSH2 mutation in English and North American HNPCC families: origin, phenotypic expression, and sex specific differences in colorectal cancer.
The frequency, origin, and phenotypic expression of a germline MSH2 gene mutation previously identified in seven kindreds with hereditary non-polyposis cancer syndrome (HNPCC) was investigated. The mutation (A-- > T at nt943 + 3) disrupts the 3 splice site of exon 5 leading to the deletion of this exon from MSH2 mRNA and represents the only frequent MSH2 mutation so far reported. Although this mutation was initially detected in four of 33 colorectal cancer families analysed from eastern England, more extensive analysis has reduced the frequency to four of 52 (8%) English HNPCC kindreds analysed. In contrast, the MSH2 mutation was identified in 10 of 20 (50%) separately identified colorectal families from Newfoundland. To investigate the origin of this mutation in colorectal cancer families from England (n = 4), Newfoundland (n = 10), and the United States (n = 3), haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers linked to MSH2 was performed. Within the English and US families there was little evidence for a recent common origin of the MSH2 splice site mutation in most families. In contrast, a common haplotype was identified at the two flanking markers (CA5 and D2S288) in eight of the Newfoundland families. These findings suggested a founder effect within Newfoundland similar to that reported by others for two MLH1 mutations in Finnish HNPCC families. We calculated age related risks of all, colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancers in nt943 + 3 A-- > T MSH2 mutation carriers (n = 76) for all patients and for men and women separately. For both sexes combined, the penetrances at age 60 years for all cancers  and for colorectal cancer were 0. 86 and 0. 57, respectively. The risk of colorectal cancer was significantly higher (p < 0. 01) in males than females (0. 63 v 0. 30 and 0. 84 v 0. 44 at ages 50 and 60 years, respectively). For females there was a high risk of endometrial cancer (0. 5 at age 60 years) and premenopausal ovarian cancer (0. 2 at 50 years). These intersex differences in colorectal cancer risks have implications for screening programmes and for attempts to identify colorectal cancer susceptibility modifiers.

Dominant negative effect of the APC1309 mutation: a possible explanation for genotype-phenotype correlations in familial adenomatous polyposis.
Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product initiates colorectal tumorigenesis. Patients with familial APC (FAP) carry germ-line mutations in the APC gene and develop multiple colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas early in life. The severity of the disease correlates with the position of the inherited APC mutation (genotype-phenotype correlation). Together with the fact that both germ-line and sporadic APC mutations cluster in the central region of the APC gene, this points to a dominant negative effect of certain APC mutants. Loss of APC function was recently shown to result in enhanced beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect of APC gene products associated with severe polyposis. Wild-type APC activity in beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant APC that is truncated at codon 1309. In contrast, mutant APC gene products that are associated with attenuated polyposis (codon 386 or 1465) interfered only weakly with wild-type APC activity. These results suggest a molecular explanation for the genotype-phenotype correlation in FAP patients and support the idea that colorectal tumor growth might be, in part, driven by selection for a mutation in the mutation cluster region..

Germline E-cadherin gene (CDH1) mutations predispose to familial gastric cancer and colorectal cancer.
Inherited mutations in the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) were described recently in three Maori kindreds with familial gastric cancer. Familial gastric cancer is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric cancer susceptibility in non-Maori populations is due to germline CDH1 mutations. Therefore, we screened eight familial gastric cancer kindreds of British and Irish origin for germline CDH1 mutations, by SSCP analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences. Each family contained  (i) two cases of gastric cancer in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years; or (ii) three or more cases of gastric cancer. Novel germline CDH1 mutations (a nonsense and a splice site) were detected in two families (25%). Both mutations were predicted to truncate the E-cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain. In one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancer; thus, in addition to six cases of gastric cancer, a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30 years. We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric cancer in non-Maori populations. However, only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations. Loss of E-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers, and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal cancer. Thus, CDH1 should be investigated as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancers.
