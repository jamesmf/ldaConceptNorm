An intrachromosomal insertion causing 5q22 deletion and familial adenomatous polyposis coli in two generations.
We report familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAPC) with epidermoid cysts, osteomata, and areas of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPEs) in a male patient and his maternal aunt, both of whom suffered a mild to moderate degree of mental handicap. Both had an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (del (5) (q22q23. 2)). Two other normal family members had the underlying direct insertion of chromosome 5 (dir ins (5) (q31. 3q22q23 3q22q23. 2)). Molecular genetic and fluorescent hybridisation studies have shown that loci D5S37 and D5S98 are outside the deletion whereas loci detected by probes EF5. 44 and YN5. 48 are lost. As expected, the molecular analyses indicate loss of one allele at the MCC and APC loci. The APC gene is located within band 5q22. Familial direct insertions should be considered as a cause of recurrent microdeletion syndromes.

Restriction of ocular fundus lesions to a specific subgroup of APC mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli patients.
In humans, alteration of the tumor suppressor gene, APC, causes adenomatous polyposis coli, a condition causing predisposition to colorectal cancer. The syndrome inconsistently associates characteristic patches of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). Ocular examination revealed that patients expressing CHRPE tend to cluster within specific families. The exact APC mutation was identified in 42 unrelated patients. In all cases these mutations were predicted to lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein. The extent of CHRPE was found to be dependent on the position of the mutation along the coding sequence. CHRPE lesions are almost always absent if the mutation occurs before exon 9, but are systematically present if it occurs after this exon. Thus, the range of phenotypic expression observed among affected patients may result in part from different allelic manifestations of APC mutations..
