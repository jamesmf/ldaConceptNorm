The incidence of PAX6 mutation in patients with simple aniridia: an evaluation of mutation detection in 12 cases.
Twelve aniridia patients, five with a family history and seven presumed to be sporadic, were exhaustively screened in order to test what proportion of people with aniridia, uncomplicated by associated anomalies, carry mutations in the human PAX6 gene. Mutations were detected in 90% of the cases. Three mutation detection techniques were used to determine if one method was superior for this gene. The protein truncation test (PTT) was used on RT-PCR products, SSCP on genomic PCR amplifications, and chemical cleavage of mismatch on both RT-PCR and genomic amplifications. For RT-PCR products, only the translated portion of the gene was screened. On genomic products exons 1 to 13 (including 740 bp of the 3 untranslated sequence and all intron/exon boundaries) were screened, as was a neuroretina specific enhancer in intron 4. Ten of the possible 12 mutations in the five familial cases and five of the sporadic patients were found, all of which conformed to a functional outcome of haploinsufficiency. Five were splice site mutations (one in the donor site of intron 4, two in the donor site of intron 6, one in each of the acceptor sites of introns 8 and 9) and five were nonsense mutations in exons 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. SSCP analysis of individually amplified exons, with which nine of the 10 mutations were seen, was the most useful detection method for PAX6..

Influence of PAX6 gene dosage on development: overexpression causes severe eye abnormalities.
Aniridia in man and Small eye in mice are semidominant developmental disorders caused by mutations within the paired box gene PAX6. Whereas heterozygotes suffer from iris hypoplasia, homozygous mice lack eyes and nasal cavities and exhibit brain abnormalities. To investigate the role of gene dosage in more detail, we have generated yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice carrying the human PAX6 locus. When crossed onto the Small eye background, the transgene rescues the mutant phenotype. Strikingly, mice carrying multiple copies on a wild-type background show specific developmental abnormalities of the eye, but not of other tissues expressing the gene. Thus, at least five different eye phenotypes are associated with changes in PAX6 expression. We provide evidence that not only reduced, but also increased levels of transcriptional regulators can cause developmental defects..

FISH studies in a patient with sporadic aniridia and t(7;11) (q31.2;p13).
A 2 year old female presenting with bilateral sporadic aniridia was found to have an apparently balanced reciprocal translocation with a chromosome 11 breakpoint within band p13. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) studies with distal 11p13 specific cosmids showed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint lay between the aniridia (PAX6) locus and a region approximately 100 kb distal to PAX6 defined by the cosmid FO2121. Although this patient did not have a detectable deletion within PAX6, her aniridia may have resulted from a disruption of the distal chromatin domain containing either enhancers or regulators for PAX6. This case may therefore be another example of aniridia caused by a position effect as recently described in two familial aniridia patients in which the phenotype cosegregated with chromosome abnormalities with 11p13 breakpoints..
