Molecular bases of C7 deficiency: three different defects.
The molecular basis of C7 deficiency has been investigated in two Irish families and a number of Israeli families of Moroccan Sephardic Jewish origin. Exon PCR and sequencing revealed a heterozygous point mutation at the 3 splice acceptor site of intron 1 in one Irish family. In the other Irish family, exons 7 and 8 failed to amplify and they were shown to be deleted. Marker haplotype studies of the C6 and C7 gene region and Southern blots show that the Irish family with the splice defect also segregate for the deletion, which is not easily detected in heterozygotes. The Israeli C7-deficient cases all share a C7 haplotype and are homozygous for a mis-sense mutation in exon 9. However, one individual is heterozygous for markers at adjacent C6 loci, showing that there has been an intergenic recombination and suggesting that the deficiency mutation is of appreciable antiquity..

Molecular bases of combined subtotal deficiencies of C6 and C7: their effects in combination with other C6 and C7 deficiencies.
Combined subtotal deficiency of C6 and C7, in which both proteins are expressed at very low levels, has been observed in homozygous form in two families. A defect at the 5 splice donor site of intron 15 of the C6 gene explains the low molecular weight of the C6 protein and is probably responsible for its low expressed concentration. The C7 defect is more enigmatic  the protein is of normal molecular weight, low circulating concentration, and altered isoelectric point. An Arg > Ser codon substitution in exon 11 is the only molecular alteration within the mature C7 protein. These defects are associated with a characteristic set of polymorphic DNA markers in the C6/C7 region, forming a distinct haplotype. The haplotype has been found in combination with a number of other haplotypes containing defective genes that lead either to C6 or C7 deficiency, but with different consequences. Where it is combined with a C6-deficient gene, the serum C7 levels can be surprisingly high, possibly because there is no C6 generating C56 to consume the C7. In contrast, where the C7 genes are both defective (but still partially functional), there may be a profound deficit of circulating C7 because there is ample C6 to produce C56 and consume the already small amount of C7. Each molecular defect has also been found in isolation and has the expected effect..

Genetic bases of human complement C7 deficiency.
Complement C7 deficiency (C7D) is associated frequently with recurrent bacterial infections, especially meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis. We report in this work the molecular bases of C7D in two unrelated Japanese males. We used exon-specific PCR/single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis as a screening step for mutations. Subsequent direct sequencing of the target exons identified homozygous mutations in exon 16 of case 1 and in exon 15 of case 2. The mutation of case 1 was a homozygous T to A transversion at nucleotide 2250, the third nucleotide of the codon TGT for Cys728, leading to a stop codon TGA (C728X). In case 2, a homozygous 2-bp deletion (2137delTG/2138delGT/2139delTG) caused a frameshift, generating a premature termination codon 4 to 6 nucleotides downstream. Family study in case 1 confirmed the genetic nature of the defect. Moreover, we detected a novel polymorphism in intron 11 that presumably is linked to the mutation responsible for C7D in case 1. Our results indicate that the pathogenesis of C7D is heterogeneous like most of the other deficiencies of complement components..
