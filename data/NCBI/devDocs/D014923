Identification of WASP mutations, mutation hotspots and genotype-phenotype disparities in 24 patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), an X-linked immunodeficiency disease caused by mutation in the recently isolated gene encoding WAS protein (WASP), is known to be associated with extensive clinical heterogeneity. Cumulative mutation data have revealed that WASP genotypes are also highly variable among WAS patients, but the relationship of phenotype with genotype in this disease remains unclear. To address this issue we characterized WASP mutations in 24 unrelated WAS patients, including 18 boys with severe classical WAS and 6 boys expressing mild forms of the disease, and then examined the degree of correlation of these as well as all previously published WASP mutations with disease severity. By analysis of these compiled mutation data, we demonstrated clustering of WASP mutations within the four most N-terminal exons of the gene and also identified several sites within this region as hotspots for WASP mutation. These characteristics were observed, however, in both severe and mild cases of the disease. Similarly, while the cumulative data revealed a predominance of missense mutations among the WASP gene lesions observed in boys with isolated thrombocytopenia, missense mutations were not exclusively associated with milder WAS phenotypes, but also comprised a substantial portion (38%) of the WASP gene defects found in patients with severe disease. These findings, as well as the detection of identical WASP mutations in patients with disparate phenotypes, reveal a lack of phenotype concordance with genotype in WAS and thus imply that phenotypic outcome in this disease cannot be reliably predicted solely on the basis of WASP genotypes..

The mouse homolog of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) gene is highly conserved and maps near the scurfy (sf) mutation on the X chromosome.
The mouse WASP gene, the homolog of the gene mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, has been isolated and sequenced. the predicted amino acid sequence is 86% identical to the human WASP sequence. A distinct feature of the mouse gene is an expanded polymorphic GGA trinucleotide repeat that codes for polyglycine and varies from 15 to 17 triplets in different Mus musculus strains. The genomic structure of the mouse WASP gene is expressed as an approximately 2. 4-kb mRNA in thymus and spleen. Chromosomal mapping in an interspecific M. Musculus/M. spretus backcross placed the Wasp locus near the centromere of the mouse X chromosome, inseparable from Gata1, Tcfe3, and scurfy (sf). This localization makes Wasp a candidate for involvement in scurfy, a T cell-mediated fatal lymphoreticular disease of mice that has previously been proposed as a mouse homolog of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Northern analysis of sf tissue samples indicated the presence of WASP mRNA in liver and skin, presumably as a consequence of lymphocytic infiltration, but non abnormalities in the amount or size of mRNA present.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: no strict genotype-phenotype correlations but clustering of missense mutations in the amino-terminal part of the WASP gene product.
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) gene was found to be mutated in patients presenting with WAS and in patients showing X-linked thrombocytopenia. Mutation analysis in 19 families of German, Swiss and Turkish descent by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing resulted in the detection of seven novel and 10 known mutations. A striking clustering of missense mutations in the first four exons contrasted with a random distribution of nonsense mutations. More than 85% of all known missense mutations were localized in the amino-terminal stretch of the WASP gene product; this region contained a mutational hot spot at codon 86. No genotype-phenotype correlation emerged after a comparison of the identified mutations with the resulting clinical picture for a classical WAS phenotype. A substitution at codon 86 resulted in an extremely variable expression of the disease in a large Swiss family. An extended homology search revealed a distant relationship of this stretch to the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), which is involved in the maintenance of cyto-architecture by interacting with actin-like filaments..

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, a novel effector for the GTPase CDC42Hs, is implicated in actin polymerization.
The Rho family of GTPases control diverse biological processes, including cell morphology and mitogenesis. We have identified WASP, the protein that is defective in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), as a novel effector for CDC42Hs, but not for the other Rho family members, Rac and Rho. This interaction is dependent on the presence of the G protein-binding domain. Cellular expression of epitope-tagged WASP produces clusters of WASP that are highly enriched in polymerized actin. This clustering is not observed with a C-terminally deleted WASP and is inhibited by coexpression with dominant negative CDC42Hs-N17, but not with dominant negative forms of Rac or Rho. Thus, WASP provides a novel link between CDC42Hs and the actin cytoskeleton, which suggests a molecular mechanism for many of the cellular abnormalities in WAS. The WASP sequence contains two novel domains that are homologous to other proteins involved in action organization..
