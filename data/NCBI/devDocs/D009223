Moderate intergenerational and somatic instability of a 55-CTG repeat in transgenic mice.
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is associated with the expansion of a (CTG) n trinucleotide repeat in the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of the DM protein kinase gene (DMPK). The (CTG) n repeat is polymorphic and varies in size between 5 and 37 repeats in unaffected individuals whereas in affected patients there are between 50 and 4, 000 CTGs. The size of the (CTG) n repeat, which increases through generations, generally correlates with clinical severity and age of onset. The instability of the CTG repeat appears to depend on its size as well as on the sex of the transmitting parent. Moreover, mitotic instability analysis of different human DM tissues shows length mosaicism between different cell lineages. The molecular mechanisms of triplet instability remain elusive. To investigate the role of genomic sequences in instability, we produced transgenic mice containing a 45-kb genomic segment with a 55-CTG repeat cloned from a mildly affected patient. In contrast to other mouse models containing CAG repeats within cDNAs, these mice showed both intergenerational and somatic repeat instability..

Mice lacking the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase develop a late onset progressive myopathy.
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3 untranslated region of a putative protein kinase (DMPK). To elucidate the role of DMPK in DM pathogenesis we have developed Dmpk deficient (Dmpk-/-) mice. Dmpk-/-mice develop a late-onset, progressive skeletal myopathy that shares some pathological features with DM. Muscles from mature mice show variation in fibre size, increased fibre degeneration and fibrosis. Adult Dmpk-/-mice show ultrastructural changes in muscle and a 50% decrease in force generation compared to young mice. Our results indicate that DMPK may be necessary for the maintenance of skeletal muscle structure and function and suggest that a decrease in DMPK levels may contribute to DM pathology..

A novel homeodomain-encoding gene is associated with a large CpG island interrupted by the myotonic dystrophy unstable (CTG)n repeat.
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is associated with a (CTG) n trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 3-untranslated region of a protein kinase-encoding gene, DMPK, which maps to chromosome 19q13. 3. Characterisation of the expression of this gene in patient tissues has thus far generated conflicting data on alterations in the steady state levels of DMPK mRNA, and on the final DMPK protein levels in the presence of the expansion. The DM region of chromosome 19 is gene rich, and it is possible that the repeat expansion may lead to dysfunction of a number of transcription units in the vicinity, perhaps as a consequence of chromatin disruption. We have searched for genes associated with a CpG island at the 3 end of DMPK. Sequencing of this region shows that the island extends over 3. 5 kb and is interrupted by the (CTG) n repeat. Comparison of genomic sequences downstream (centromeric) of the repeat in human and mouse identified regions of significant homology. These correspond to exons of a gene predicted to encode a homeodomain protein. RT-PCR analysis shows that this gene, which we have called DM locus-associated homeodomain protein (DMAHP), is expressed in a number of human tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart and brain.

Abnormal myotonic dystrophy protein kinase levels produce only mild myopathy in mice.
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is commonly associated with CTG repeat expansions within the gene for DM-protein kinase (DMPK). The effect of altered expression levels of DMPK, which is ubiquitously expressed in all muscle cell lineages during development, was examined by disrupting the endogenous Dmpk gene and overexpressing a normal human DMPK transgene in mice. Nullizygous (-/-) mice showed only inconsistent and minor size changes in head and neck muscle fibres at older age, animals with the highest DMPK transgene expression showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and enhanced neonatal mortality. However, both models lack other frequent DM symptoms including the fibre-type dependent atrophy, myotonia, cataract and male-infertility. These results strengthen the contention that simple loss- or gain-of-expression of DMPK is not the only crucial requirement for development of the disease..

Trinucleotide repeat expansion at the myotonic dystrophy locus reduces expression of DMAHP.
Myotonic dystrophy, or dystrophia myotonica (DM), is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3 untranslated region of the DMPK protein kinase gene on chromosome 19q13. 3 (refs 1-3). Although the DM mutation was identified more than five years ago, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this most prevalent form of hereditary adult neuromuscular disease remain elusive. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that a DNase l-hypersensitive site located adjacent to the repeats on the wild-type allele is eliminated by repeat expansion, indicating that large CTG-repeat arrays may be associated with a local chromatin environment that represses gene expression. Here we report that the hypersensitive site contains an enhancer element that regulates transcription of the adjacent DMAHP homeobox gene. Analysis of DMAHP expression in the cells of DM patients with loss of the hypersensitive site revealed a two- to fourfold reduction in steady-state DMAHP transcript levels relative to wild-type controls. Allele-specific analysis of DMAHP expression showed that steady-state transcript levels from the expanded allele were greatly reduced in comparison to those from the wild-type allele. Together, these results demonstrate that CTG-repeat expansions can suppress local gene expression and implicate DMAHP in DM pathogenesis.

Analysis of meiotic segregation, using single-sperm typing: meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy locus.
Meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy (DM) locus has recently been suggested as being responsible for maintaining the frequency, in the human population, of DM chromosomes capable of expansion to the disease state. In order to test this hypothesis, we have studied samples of single sperm from three individuals heterozygous at the DM locus, each with one allele larger and one allele smaller than 19 CTG repeats. To guard against the possible problem of differential PCR amplification rates based on the lengths of the alleles, the sperm were also typed at another closely linked marker whose allele size was unrelated to the allele size at the DM locus. Using statistical models specifically designed to study single-sperm segregation data, we find no evidence of meiotic segregation distortion. The upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimate of the common segregation probability for the three donors is at or below. 515 for all models considered, and no statistically significant difference from. 5 is detected in any of the models. This suggests that any greater amount of segregation distortion at the myotonic dystrophy locus must result from events following sperm ejaculation.
