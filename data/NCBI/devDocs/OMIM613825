Difficulties in the ascertainment of C9 deficiency: lessons to be drawn from a compound heterozygote C9-deficient subject.
A group of patients with long-surviving mismatched kidney allografts were investigated for complement function using haemolytic assays in agarose gels. One patient was found to have no alternative pathway activity but a low normal classical pathway. Surprisingly, investigation revealed that the patients complement was normal for all components except C9, which was functionally absent. The patient was shown to be heterozygous for DNA markers in the C6, C7 and C9 region of chromosome 5 and therefore appears to be a compound heterozygote for two uncharacterized C9 deficiency genes. Serological analysis by ELISA revealed that he has trace concentrations of a non-functional C9 molecule. Western blot analysis was not sufficiently sensitive to permit detection of this molecule. We hypothesize that the patient is heterozygous for a complete deficiency of C9 and for a gene directing hyposynthesis of a defective C9. We also suggest that C9 deficiency may be more common among Caucasians than has been reported..

The human complement C9 gene: identification of two mutations causing deficiency and revision of the gene structure.
The ninth component of human complement (C9) is the last of the terminal complement components creating the membrane attack complex. C9 is a single-chain serum protein that is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 5p. Deficiency of terminal complement components is generally associated with recurrent neisseria infections. We studied a previously described Swiss family with inherited C9 deficiency. To identify the genetic basis of C9 deficiency, we developed an approach using exon-specific PCR and direct DNA sequencing. As a cause of C9 deficiency , we found two different point mutations, both generating TGA stop codons in the coding sequence. One mutation, a C to A exchange, was detected in exon 2 at cDNA position 166, the other, a C to T exchange, was located in exon 4 (cDNA position 464). In family studies of three first-degree relatives with heterozygous C9 deficiency, we demonstrated that the two mutations are segregating independently. Therefore, these mutations are sufficient to explain the complete deficiency of both the probands studied. DNA sequencing of the exon-intron junctions revealed a number of revisions regarding the boundaries between exons 4, 5, and 6 as well as between exons 10 and 11. No additional introns were detected in exons 6 and 10. Furthermore, DNA marker studies were conducted using known polymorphisms of the C6, C7, and C9 genes, confirming the linkage of the observed C9 mutations with defined haplotypes..
