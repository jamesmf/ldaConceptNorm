The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product interacts with Sp1 to repress vascular endothelial growth factor promoter activity.
The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) has a critical role in the pathogenesis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), as VHL mutations have been found in both von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated and sporadic RCCs. Recent studies suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA is upregulated in RCC- and von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors. We have therefore assessed the effect of the VHL gene product on VEGF expression. VEGF promoter-luciferase constructs were transiently cotransfected with a wild-type VHL (wt-VHL) vector in several cell lines, including 293 embryonic kidney and RCC cell lines. wt-VHL protein inhibited VEGF promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner up to 5- to 10-fold. Deletion analysis defined a 144-bp region of the VEGF promoter necessary for VHL repression. This VHL-responsive element is GC rich and specifically binds the transcription factor Sp1 in crude nuclear extracts. In Drosophila cells, cotransfected VHL represses Sp1-mediated activation but not basal activity of the VEGF promoter. We next demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitates that VHL and Sp1 were part of the same complex and, by using a glutathione-S-transferase-VHL fusion protein and purified Sp1, that VHL and Sp1 directly interact. Furthermore, endogenous VEGF mRNA levels were suppressed in permanent RCC cell lines expressing wt-VHL, and nuclear run-on studies indicated that VHL regulation of VEGF occurs at least partly at the transcriptional level. These observations support a new mechanism for VHL-mediated transcriptional repression via a direct inhibitory action on Sp1 and suggest that loss of Sp1 inhibition may be important in the pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease and RCC..

Mutation of the VHL gene is associated exclusively with the development of non-papillary renal cell carcinomas.
To define the possible role of the VHL gene in the development of sporadic renal cell carcinomas, 91 different parenchymal tumours of the kidney have been investigated for mutation of the VHL gene by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and/or heteroduplex (HD) techniques. Chromosome 3p deletion was detected in 98 per cent of non-papillary renal cell carcinomas and in 25 per cent of chromophobe renal cell carcinomas. In 22 of the 43 non-papillary renal cell carcinomas, abnormally migrating DNA bands were detected by SSCP and/or HD analysis. No mobility shift was seen in any of the 23 chromophobe renal cell carcinomas. In addition, 15 papillary renal cell tumours and ten renal oncocytomas, which are characterized by genetic changes other than loss of chromosome 3p sequences, were analysed for mutation of the VHL gene. None of these tumours showed abnormal migration patterns. The results indicate that mutation of the VHL gene is associated exclusively with the development of non-papillary renal cell carcinoma..

Expression of the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumour suppressor gene during human embryogenesis.
The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease product is thought to down-regulate transcription by antagonizing elongin-enhanced transcriptional elongation. Germline VHL gene mutations predispose to the development of retinal, cerebellar and spinal haemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma. In addition, somatic Inactivation of the VHL gene is frequent in sporadic renal cell carcinoma and haemangioblastoma. Regulation of transcript elongation is an important control mechanism for gene expression and the VHL gene might modify the expression of proto-oncogenes and growth suppressor genes during embryogenesis. We therefore investigated the expression of VHL mRNA during human embryogenesis by in situ hybridization studies at 4, 6 and 10 weeks post conception. Although VHL mRNA was expressed in all three germ layers, strong expression was noted in the central nervous system, kidneys, testis and lung. Within the kidney, VHL mRNA was differentially expressed within renal tubules suggesting that the VHL gene product may have a specific role in kidney development. Two alternatively spliced VHL mRNAs characterized by inclusion (isoform I) or exclusion (isoform II) of exon 2 are transcribed in adult tissues. To investigate if the two isoforms are differentially expressed during embryogenesis, VHL mRNA was reverse transcribed from 13 fetal tissues (8-10 weeks gestation). The quantitative distribution of VHL mRNA within fetal tissues reflected that seen by in situ hybridization and the ratio of the two VHL isoforms was similar between tissues. Although the genes regulated by the VHL gene product have not yet been identified, our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that VHL-mediated control of transcriptional elongation may have a role in normal human development..
