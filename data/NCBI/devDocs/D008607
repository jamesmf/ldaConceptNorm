Kniest dysplasia: Dr. W. Kniest, his patient, the molecular defect.
Kniest dysplasia is a severe chondrodysplasia caused by the defective formation of type II collagen. We report about Dr. Kniest, who first described the condition in 1952, and his patient, who, at the age of 50 years is severely handicapped with short stature, restricted joint mobility, and blindness but is mentally alert and leads an active life. Molecular analysis of the patients DNA showed a single base (G) deletion involving the GT dinucleotide at the start of intron 18 destroying a splice site of the COL2A1 gene. This is in accordance with molecular findings in other patients with Kniest dysplasia and confirms, in the original patient, that the disorder is caused by small inframe deletions often due to exon skipping as a result of COL2A1 splice site mutations..

Nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the proteolipid protein gene (PLP) in a family with an unusual form of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.
We report a G-- > A transition at nucleotide 431 of the proteolipid protein gene (PLP) results in a nonsense codon in a family with an unusual form of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). The mutation, which creates a second AluI restriction site, results in a nonsense mutation in PLP. The clinical picture resembles somewhat that of X-linked spastic paraplegia (SPG). It differs from this and both the classical and connatal forms of PMD in that it is relatively mild in form, onset is delayed beyond age 2 years, nystagmus is absent, tremors are prominent, mental retardation is not severe, some patients show dementia or personality disorders, the disease is progressive rather than static in some, and several females show signs of disease. The nonsense mutation, which is in exon 3B, should block the synthesis of normal PLP but spare DM20, the isoform whose persistence has been associated with mild forms of PLP-associated disease in both humans and mice..
