Nonsense mutation in exon 4 of human complement C9 gene is the major cause of Japanese complement C9 deficiency.
Deficiency of the ninth component of human complement (C9) is the most common complement deficiency in Japan but is rare in other countries. We studied the molecular basis of C9 deficiency in four Japanese C9-deficient patients who had suffered from meningococcal meningitis. Direct sequencing of amplified C9 cDNA and DNA revealed a nonsense substitution (CGA-- > TGA) at codon 95 in exon 4 in the four C9-deficient individuals. An allele-specific polymerase chain reaction system designed to detect exclusively only one of the normal and mutant alleles indicated that all the four patients were homozygous for the mutation in exon 4 and that the parents of patient 2 were heterozygous. The common mutation at codon 95 in exon 4 might be responsible for most Japanese C9 deficiency..

Human complement factor H deficiency associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome.
This study reports on six cases of deficiency in the human complement regulatory protein Factor H (FH) in the context of an acute renal disease. Five of the cases were observed in children presenting with idiopathic hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Two of the children exhibited a homozygous deficiency characterized by the absence of the 150-kD form of Factor H and the presence, upon immunoblotting, of the 42-kD Factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) and other FH-related protein (FHR) bands. Southern blot and PCR analysis of DNA of one patient with homozygous deficiency ruled out the presence of a large deletion of the FH gene as the underlying defect for the deficiency. The other four children presented with heterozygous deficiency and exhibited a normal immunoblotting pattern of proteins of the FH family. Factor H deficiency is the only complement deficiency associated with HUS. These observations suggest a role for FH and/or FH receptors in the pathogenesis of idiopathic HUS..
